**Interview Self-Introduction (Full Story)**

Good morning, and thank you very much for this opportunity. My name is Chuchu Xu. I‚Äôm an MSc Mechatronics graduate from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and I‚Äôve lived and worked in Germany for more than eight years. As of 2025, I‚Äôve also become a German citizen, so I feel deeply rooted in Europe both personally and professionally.

of course I am a technical person so my main role is engineer, and I have done tons of technical work, (...È°πÁõÆ‰ªãÁªç ) 

My career has always been at the intersection of German engineering precision and Chinese innovation speed. I like to describe myself as a *bridge-builder*‚Äîsomeone who can connect Europe‚Äôs vibrant tech ecosystem with Chinese or global R&D organizations. This comes from my background: I‚Äôve worked in Sino-German joint ventures like FAWAY-HELLA, FLEX-Elektrowerkzeuge, and BHsense, where I often acted as both a cultural and technical translator. For example, at Hella I aligned German ISO 26262 standards with Chinese production requirements for the Audi A6 headlamp project. At FLEX, which is part of a Chinese group, I optimized DV/PV testing and even introduced AI-assisted validation, which cut failure rates by 15%.

Alongside my corporate roles, I also co-founded a small start-up in Backnang. We focused on circuit board design, EMI testing, and developed prototypes such as an automated greenhouse and a camshaft test bench. It wasn‚Äôt a big commercial success, but it was a great learning journey that gave me valuable experience in taking full ownership of projects, managing resources, and building solutions from concept to prototype. It also showed me clearly that I thrive most in structured environments with strong resources, professional teams, and long-term product goals‚Äîwhich is why I‚Äôm eager to join an innovative and established company like Huawei.

Another strength no less as a personal hobby I bring is **technology scouting and network building**. Over the past years, I‚Äôve built a network of more than 50 contacts in Germany‚Äîprofessors at KIT, engineers at Bosch and Siemens affiliates, and founders of Stuttgart-based startups. I use a multi-channel approach: online platforms like Crunchbase, offline engagement at fairs like IAA Mobility and VDI congresses, and of course my alumni network for warm introductions. A concrete example: at FLEX, I connected our R&D team with a Stuttgart sensor startup, which led to a pilot project that boosted our testing efficiency by 20%. I organized management visits, handled IP discussions, and structured the collaboration. I also like to attend tech talks‚Äîsometimes a CEO‚Äôs talk tells you more about a company‚Äôs direction than any PowerPoint or business chart.

I also have a strong interest in tracking business news, regulations, and geopolitical shifts. like what happens recently in syllicon vally, any coperate takeovers, there is tons of intereting stories in business world, there is a lot to learn from a success story as well as failed ones.  I also have a passion for **trend analysis and feasibility ‚Äúreality checks.‚Äù** Just as Wall Street analysts do due diligence on investments, I try to do technical and strategic due diligence on new technologies. At Poppe Mechatronik, I was tracking the EU Battery Regulation and noticed a trend in using AI for validation. I ran a feasibility study in MATLAB and Python that showed a potential 15% reduction in failure rates, which directly influenced our roadmap. At FLEX, I did something similar for sensor longevity testing, which helped shape a three-year plan. I see this skill as directly relevant to technology planning at Huawei‚Äîbecause it‚Äôs not just about spotting exciting technologies, it‚Äôs about asking: are they feasible, scalable, and compliant?  My criteria for evaluating a company‚Äôs growth potential are: technology, data, and innovation.

Of course, feasibility is not only technical. It‚Äôs also geopolitical. And I understand Huawei‚Äôs position very well. It is both a national champion driving Chinese tech self-reliance and a company under intense Western scrutiny. I‚Äôve personally experienced political barriers: earlier this year, I passed the interview and was offered a position at Esslingen University‚Äôs regelungtechnik lab, but due to Germany‚Äôs export control policy linked to my undergraduate university, which is in the sanction list, so they retrieve the offer. Which is actually against the german law of anti-discrimination. That decision was purely political, not about my competence, but it gave me first-hand awareness of how non-technical risks can affect careers and companies. That perspective allows me to anticipate issues like export controls, GDPR changes for connected cars, or certification delays, and propose strategies to navigate them.

I should also mention communication. I see one of my strengths as **structural communication and information integration**. I use AI tools to help me summarize, structure, and integrate information across projects, and I strongly prefer employers who embrace AI in their business processes. For me, Huawei‚Äôs commitment to AI, HarmonyOS, and smart mobility is a big motivation to join.

Finally, I‚Äôm someone who understands both the German way of doing business‚Äîstructured, punctual, direct, formal‚Äîand the Chinese pace of innovation. I believe this dual perspective is essential for a company like Huawei to succeed in Europe.

In summary: I bring deep German roots, a trilingual profile, proven experience in Sino-German collaborations, an entrepreneurial mindset, and strong skills in technology scouting, trend analysis, and communication. I‚Äôm confident I can contribute to Huawei‚Äôs Automotive Engineering Lab by scouting high-potential technologies, conducting reality checks, and building the right partnerships to strengthen Huawei‚Äôs position in Europe‚Äôs automotive ICT ecosystem.

**Self-Introduction (Interview Monologue)**

Good morning/afternoon, thank you for this opportunity. My name is Chuchu Xu, and I‚Äôm an MSc Mechatronics graduate from KIT with over eight years of engineering experience in the German automotive industry. I‚Äôm particularly excited about this Technology Planning Expert role because it perfectly aligns with my strengths: scouting emerging technologies, analyzing trends, and building strategic cooperations.

Throughout my career, I‚Äôve often been a *bridge-builder* between German engineering precision and Chinese innovation speed, especially in Sino-German joint ventures. I believe this unique background allows me to connect Europe‚Äôs vibrant tech ecosystem with Huawei‚Äôs R&D, adding immediate value to your team.

**Technology Scouting and Network Building**

One of my strongest assets is the network I‚Äôve built over the past eight years in Germany. Through my studies at KIT and professional roles, I‚Äôve cultivated more than 50 contacts with technology-leading companies, startups, and professors. I‚Äôm prepared to leverage this network immediately for scouting and management visits.

For example, at FLEX, I used my alumni connections to link our R&D team with a Stuttgart-based sensor startup. This led to a pilot project that improved testing efficiency by 20%. I organized management visits, facilitated IP discussions, and co-developed an EU-compliant certification process. That‚Äôs the kind of bridge-building I would bring here‚Äîidentifying promising partners and structuring collaborations that deliver results.

To find opportunities, I combine online research on platforms like Crunchbase with offline engagement at fairs like IAA Mobility, and I use warm introductions through my personal network. I also like to attend tech-talks‚Äîsometimes when a CEO gives a talk, it‚Äôs more informative than any business chart.

**Entrepreneurial Experience and Technical Depth**

After my time at Flex, I co-founded a small engineering start-up with a colleague. We focused on circuit board design, EMI testing, and test rig development, and we built prototypes such as an automated greenhouse and a camshaft test bench.

While the business was more of a learning journey than a commercial success, it gave me invaluable experience: taking full ownership of projects, managing limited resources, and developing solutions from concept to prototype. It also clarified what motivates me. I thrive when applying my expertise in a structured environment with strong resources, professional teams, and long-term product goals. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm looking to join an innovative and established company like Huawei‚Äîwhere I can combine my entrepreneurial mindset with stability and growth opportunities.

---

**Trend Analysis and Navigating Geopolitical Realities**

 I believe this instinct is crucial for the ‚Äúreality checks‚Äù in technology planning.

At Poppe Mechatronik, for instance, I monitored EU Battery Regulation updates and noticed AI applications in validation. I ran a feasibility study with MATLAB and Python and showed we could reduce failure rates by 15% while staying compliant.

This awareness is particularly relevant for Huawei‚Äôs global position. I‚Äôve personally experienced political restrictions: earlier this year, I passed the interview and was offered a position at Esslingen University‚Äôs regulation lab, but due to Germany‚Äôs export control policy‚Äîlinked to my undergraduate university‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt allowed to take it. The decision was political, not about my skills, and it reinforced my awareness of these non-technical barriers. This perspective helps me anticipate risks, like export controls or GDPR changes, and propose strategies so that roadmaps are both innovative and resilient.

**Sino-German Joint Venture and Communication Skills**

What also sets me apart is my hands-on experience in Sino-German joint ventures like FAWAY-HELLA and FLEX. These roles taught me to act as a cultural and technical translator, balancing precise German standards like ISO 26262 with China‚Äôs rapid production demands.

This experience trained me to steer complex international projects end-to-end, build consensus among diverse stakeholders, and keep projects on track. I‚Äôd describe one of my strengths as structural communication and information integration, which I‚Äôve enhanced by adopting AI tools in my daily work. In fact, I value companies that integrate AI models into their internal systems and business processes‚Äîit‚Äôs one of my evaluation criteria for employers.
