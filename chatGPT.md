**connect the dots** so it flows like a natural, spoken self-introduction in an interview, while still touching on *all* your key messages: background, professional skills, entrepreneurial journey, Sino-German “bridge-builder,” technology scouting, trend analysis, geopolitical awareness, AI, and even German business etiquette/Wall Street perspective.

**Interview Self-Introduction (Full Story)**

so I’ve lived and worked in Germany for eight years now, studied at Karlsruhe and worked at FLEX, and yeah, I feel like I am rooted in germany both personally and professionally. before I came to germany I have worked in China for four years, at Hella and at FAW; I have started my career early on and mostly in the environment of Sino-German joint venture kind of company, in a international team with mixed culture, either it's a german company with chinese ties or chinese company with german ties. So I am used to connect german engineering methodologies with precision and tech ecosystem with Chinese organization mindset and supply chain and rapid speed of innovation. At FLEX, for example, I have independently managed and steered international projects end-to-end, build consensus among diverse stakeholders, and keep projects on track. A concrete example would be, I was in charge of the lawn mower robot project, and I have done my own research and connected with a startup in stuttgart, who agrees to offer their navigation module to be embedded into our lawm mower robot, I organized management visits, handled quotation and technical discussions, and structured the whole collaboration. And another example while I was tracking the Battery Regulation in europe and noticed a trend in china in using AI for validation. so I ran feasibility study and offer solutions to my chinese colleagues to reduce failure rates and keep compliant. and I utilized my alumni connections to link our R&D team with university labotory to do some advanced tests. so I always call myself as a *bridge-builder* because I often acted as a cultural and technical translator, I’d describe this skill as structural communication and information integration, which probably align with this position, I think I am capable of connecting Europe’s tech ecosystem with Huawei’s cutting-edge technology.

another skills I have built over the years Through my studies and professional roles, no less as a hobby, to put in a formal pharse is the so-called **technology scouting and network building**, so if you go to places you meet people right, and I believe people are the best assets. I’ve cultivated some contacts and maintained in more or less a personal relationship, like the professor who tutored my master thesis, whom I still write to once in a while, talking about the new trends of technology, and my old boss and colleagues, some I call friends. So if you count my alumni from university and linkedIn connections then I have a networks with 2/300 people. they are not my close friends but I am sure if I write emails or call in a polite way half of them would respond. I would immediately leverage this network for scouting and possible management visits.

at the moment together with my boyfriend we have set up a small start-up workshop in Backnang, and we also like to seek other Entrepreneurs, mostly Stuttgart-based, offline we like to engage at trade fairs like IAA Mobility in münchen and VDI congresses, we do research in online platforms like Crunchbase for other startups, I also like to attend tech-talks—sometimes when a CEO gives a talk, it’s more informative than any business chart. It's all very interesting. 

Although the business side is not very exciting, it's more of a learning journey than a commercial success, but there is so much to learn from a failure not less than success. it gave me valuable experience: taking full ownership of projects, managing  resources, building connections, and developing solutions from concept to prototype. we have many **3D printers** in house; we built an **industrial 3D printer** by ourselves which can print large parts like furniture. and we set up a small **electrical laboratory** and acquired some lab equipment, like **spectrum analyzer** and **oscilloscope** **signal generator** **power station**, a **CNC machine**, and a **soldering station** we can carry out basic **measurements and do analyses on sensors and actuators**, like **electromagnetic interference tests**, and PCB design and 3D construction, and build prototypes like an automated greenhouse and a camshaft test bench.

another thing of mine, much like a hobby is tracking business news, regulations, and geopolitical shifts. like what's new in business world, what happens recently in syllicon vally, any coperate takeovers, I also have a personal interest for, to quote from the job description, **trend analysis and feasibility “reality checks.”**  I have my own sets of criteria for evaluating a company’s growth potential: technology, data, and innovation. Just as Wall Street analysts do due diligence on investments, I do my own technical and strategic due diligence on new technologies. because it’s not just about spotting exciting technologies, it’s more about asking: are they feasible, scalable, and compliant? and I also have adopted AI tools in my daily workflow and make information flows faster. In my opinion one of the criterias to evaluate a company is to see if they integrate AI models into their internal systems and business processes, and Huawei is a clear **frontrunner** here.

Of course, feasibility is not only technical. It’s also geopolitical. I’ve personally experienced political barrier recently: last month, I was offered a position at Hochschule Esslingen at their regelungtechnik lab and I am supposed to start from october, but due to Germany’s export control policy linked to my undergraduate university in china, which is in the sanction list, they retrieve the offer last minute and I was told I am not allowed to work for any german university or hochschule. Which is kind of against the german law of anti-discrimination. I started the legal process but is dead end. That was purely political, nothing about my competence, but it gave me first-hand awareness of how non-technical risks can affect one's career and in some cases companies too. so I understand Huawei’s position very well. It is both a national champion driving Chinese tech self-reliance and a company operates under intense Western **scrutiny**. so we need to take this unique perspective and indentify political risk early on develop strategies to naigate them smartly so that our roadmaps are both innovative and resilient, and always keep an eye on issues like export controls, GDPR changes, semiconductor export controls, or EU certification processes.

so every chinese definately know huawei, and what I know about Huawei is its **unique strengths**, it's a technology leading company in lots of aspects, it has massive R&D investment — nearly 21% of revenue in 2024; over 240,000 patents, global leadership in 5G; and an automotive business that grew fourfold last year. The **ADS Qiankun system** is already deployed in over 22 production models, and the **HarmonyOS cockpit** combined with 5G-V2X gives Huawei an ecosystem advantage that few others can match. I see Huawei as a true orchestrator in the automotive value chain, not just a Tier 1 supplier.  if I were to take this role at your lab, I would start to actively build strategy to approach the potential company and targeting particular personel to build business relationship. From my perspective, Huawei's potentials in europe-China links promises scouting high-value trends like L3 autonomy, which has immediate roadmap value.

so I think I fit into this role because it aligns with my skills: scouting emerging technologies, analyzing trends, and building strategic cooperations. Maybe I need a bit time to become an expert in this, public relations and resource integration,  scouting. but I believe I have unique qualities, In the current time of artificial intelligence, many skills like data processing and information searching are being outperformed by AI, but some remain irreplaceable, like creativity and particularly empathy and the ability to understand and connect with other people, and instinct, which I believe is crucial for the “reality checks” in technology planning. ....... The common practice is to first work coloborateviely for soem projects, then move to joint venture.............

Example 1: Technical Due Diligence for a Potential Acquisition/Partnership
Scenario: My team was evaluating a startup specializing in advanced LiDAR technology for autonomous driving, a promising but complex and unproven area.
Action: I led the 'reality check' on their core technology. This involved a deep dive into their technical documentation, reviewing their patent portfolio, conducting in-depth interviews with their engineering team, and hands-on evaluation of their prototypes in a controlled environment. My focus was on assessing the maturity of their technology, its scalability, potential integration challenges with existing systems, and associated risks. I then synthesized this comprehensive technical assessment into a clear, actionable report for the investment committee.
Result: My detailed technical feasibility report provided critical insights that informed the investment decision. In this instance, my 'reality check' identified a significant scalability hurdle related to manufacturing costs, which led us to restructure the partnership agreement to include joint R&D efforts, mitigating our initial investment risk and ensuring a more robust path to commercialization.

so, to sum up, I have dual perspective, I understand both the German way of doing business and the Chinese way. I have substantial Sino-German project experience and a german network, and also technical expertise in mechatronics, and I believe I can contribute to your team, in tasks like scouting high-potential technologies, conducting feasibility checks, building the right partnerships with European companies, building innovative and resilient roadmap, and to strengthen Huawei’s position in Europe. and I would like to apply these skills and my engineering expertise in a structured and meaningful way, so to join Huawei is very much the right way, I get to combine my own growth and coincide with the long-term goals of an innovative and well established company. this is quite exciting.

1. At the moment, I’m working independently together with a colleague. We’ve rented a small workshop here in Backnang. Most of our work involves **3D printers** — right now, we’re building an **industrial 3D printer** with a large build volume for printing big parts like furniture components.

2. We’ve also set up a small **electronics lab** and got some equipment, so we can do **basic measurements and analyses on sensors and actuators**. We’ve got stuff like a **spectrum analyzer**, **oscilloscope** (for checking **electromagnetic interference**), **signal generator**, **power supply**, **CNC machine**, and a **soldering station**.

3. Occasionally, we get projects from clients — for example, from Heilbronn University. We’re developing **test benches**, like one for **surface and horn measurement of camshafts** — my colleague mainly handles that part.

4. I also develop **test stations for mechatronic systems**. For example, I designed a test setup for a **DDS Axle Load Sensor**, which is a **Hall-based sensor** that measures **position and pressure** in real time — basically the **axle load through suspension deformation**.
   Since these sensors can become **inaccurate under extreme environmental conditions** (like temperature fluctuations from -20°C to +80°C), we need to run tests and perform **root cause analyses**. I’ve written MATLAB scripts for data analysis and developed an **AI-assisted validation tool** to detect patterns and make predictions.

5. In parallel, I’m also working with **ROS** and building **robot arms** — that’s something I started back when I was at **KIT**.

6. Every now and then, **private customers** drop by with devices for repair. We run some tests and fix the electronics.

7. Before that, I was at **FLEX**, working in development. I contributed to several products and built a **prototype of an autonomous lawn mower**, mostly focusing on the software side.

8. I’ve done a lot of work on **motor control systems** — which is the key part in **power tool design**, like **cordless orbital sanders with variable speed control**.
   Basically, there are three main types:

   * The simplest type **has no feedback**, using **open-loop PWM signals**, like in **leaf blowers, chainsaws, or garden shears**, where precision isn’t critical.

9. Then there are systems **with feedback**, using **Hall sensors** for **closed-loop torque and speed control**. These are used in tools that need **higher precision**, like **drills, grinders, or polishers**.

10. The most advanced form is **field-oriented control (FOC)** — that’s used in **autonomous lawn mowers**.

11. I also do a lot of **testing** — things like **electrical and mechanical performance, vibration and noise levels, temperature tests, durability, and reliability**.
    I perform **FMEA analyses**, prepare **technical documentation for CE certifications**, and write **reports according to ISO standards**.

12. I also build **test setups**. One example was the **validation of a cordless grinder**:
    It includes **pressure and inductive Hall sensors** to measure the **motor’s rotational speed**. Under **heavy load**, **overheating** can occur, making the sensors **unstable**, which leads to **automatic shutdowns**.
    I ran tests to find the **root cause** — for example, **dust buildup in the ventilation**, causing heat accumulation, or **PCB design issues**, where **heat-generating components (like MOSFETs)** were placed too close to the sensor, leading to **thermal drift**.
    To solve such problems, I run **DV (Design Verification)** and **PV (Product Validation)** tests, create **test procedures**, and do **data analysis with MATLAB and Python**.

13. During testing, I came up with an idea:
    Important parameters like **temperature, current, voltage, and speed** are usually recorded manually — which is tedious.
    So I thought about collecting that data **automatically** using a **data logger**. It’s basically an interface between the battery and the machine that automatically records, analyzes, visualizes, and stores the data.
    The prototype can even be built into real products to collect **live operational data**. With enough data, we can **further optimize the motor control parameters**.

14. On the side, I also support **smaller projects** — like **battery testing, EMC tests**, and help with **prototype manufacturing and certification** in cooperation with external labs.

15. Before that, I worked at **HELLA**, where I was responsible for **CAD drawings** and for checking **design plans** according to standards before release.

16. I also worked in **process planning** for headlight production lines — where I gained experience in **PLC programming, electrical schematics, and troubleshooting**, mainly using **Siemens TIA**.

*  while at FLEX I optimized DV/PV testing and introduced AI-assisted validation that cut failure rates by 15%.
For example, at Hella I aligned German ISO 26262 standards with Chinese production requirements for the Audi A6 headlamp project. At FLEX, which is part of a Chinese group, I optimized DV/PV testing and even introduced AI-assisted validation, which cut failure rates by 15%.

of course I am a technical person so my main role is engineer, and I have done tons of technical work, (...项目介绍 ) 

 our topics are very broad, mechatronics, sensortechnik dataanalyse processoptimization ..  We focused on circuit board design, EMI testing, and developed prototypes such as an automated greenhouse and a camshaft test bench. It wasn’t a big commercial success, but it was a great learning journey that gave me valuable experience in taking full ownership of projects, managing resources, and building solutions from concept to prototype.





3. I also develop **test stations** for **mechatronic systems**. For example, we once received an order from HS Heilbronn, where I designed a test setup for a **DDS axle load sensor**, a **Hall-based** sensor capable of real-time measurement of **position and pressure**, specifically the axle load caused by the deformation of the suspension. Because these sensors can **provide inaccurate readings under extreme environmental conditions (e.g., temperature fluctuations from -20°C to +80°C)**, tests and **root-cause analyses** are necessary. I wrote MATLAB scripts for data analysis and developed an AI-powered validation tool to detect patterns in the data and make predictions.
4. We also have a few other projects, such as **developing experimental setups and a test stand for measuring the surface profile of camshafts**, although this is mainly handled by my colleague.
5. In parallel, I continue to work with ROS and am tinkering with robotic arms—a project I started at KIT.
6. Occasionally, private customers visit and bring devices for repair; we conduct tests and repair electronics.



1. At FLEX, I worked in development and participated in several products. I built a **prototype for an autonomous lawn mower**, mainly focusing on software.
2. I spent a lot of time on **motor control**, which is also the most important aspect of designing **power tools**, such as **cordless random orbital sanders with variable speed control**. Basically, there are three types: the simplest has no feedback, meaning **PWM signals in open-loop control**, for example, **leaf blowers, chainsaws, or garden shears**—tools with **low accuracy requirements**.
3. Then there are control methods with feedback signals, using a **hall sensor**, so it’s **closed-loop PWM torque and speed control**, which are used in tools with **higher accuracy requirements**, such as **drills, grinders, or polishers**.
4. There’s also a more advanced method, namely **field-oriented control**, which is used in **autonomous lawn mowers**.
5. I also perform many tests, like measuring **electrical power, mechanical power, vibration and noise, temperature, endurance, and reliability**. I conduct **FMEA analyses** and create the **technical documentation for CE certifications and prepare reports according to ISO standards**.
6. I develop **test setups** as well; one concrete example was **validating a battery-powered sander**. It integrates **pressure and inductive hall sensors** to measure the **rotational speed of the motor**. During **heavy load**, **overheating** can occur, making the sensors **unreliable and unstable** and leading to **automatic shutdowns** of the power tool. Then, I run tests to find the **root cause**, whether it’s **dust buildup in the ventilation**, causing heat accumulation, or **PCB design errors** with heat-generating components (e.g., MOSFETs) placed too close to the sensor, causing thermal drift. To solve these problems, it is sometimes necessary to conduct **DV (Design Verification) and PV (Product Validation) tests**, create **test procedures**, and perform **data analysis using MATLAB and Python**. Here’s an example.
7. During these test processes, I had the idea that parameters like **temperature, current, voltage, and rotational speed** are always collected manually. So, I came up with the idea of automatically collecting the data, which led to the **datalogger**—an interface between the battery and the machine. This tool can automatically record, evaluate, graphically display, and save the data for later analysis. The prototype can even be integrated into real products to collect actual working data. The concept is: with enough data, the motor control parameters can be further optimized.
8. Additionally, I also contributed to some small projects, like **battery tests, EMC** evaluations, and supported **prototype manufacturing and certification with external laboratories**.

I should also mention communication. I have my own way of work, usually when I'm dealing with a topic, I would firstly collect as much as information on the topic, and integrate them into my point of view, then I would form my auguments in a structural way to communicate effectively. I use AI tools to help me summarize, structure, and integrate information across projects, and I strongly prefer employers who embrace AI in their business processes. For me, Huawei’s commitment to AI, HarmonyOS, and smart mobility is a big motivation to join.

**Huawei’s Advantages and Why I’m Motivated**
“What excites me about Huawei is its **technical and business strengths** that no other automotive newcomer can match. For example:

* In 2024, Huawei invested **CNY 179.7 billion (USD 25B)** into R&D — **20.8% of revenue**, which shows long-term commitment to innovation.
* The company holds **over 240,000 patents**, including **13,473 in 5G**, making it the world leader.
* The automotive unit’s revenue grew **4x in 2024** and turned profitable for the first time, with a valuation around **$16 billion**.
* Huawei’s **ADS (Qiankun system)** already supports urban autonomous driving, with deployment in **22+ production models** and 23 million components shipped in 2024.
* Its **HarmonyOS cockpit** and **5G-V2X connectivity** create an ecosystem advantage that few competitors can replicate.

This scale, combined with the **asset-light Tier 1 model (“Huawei Inside”)**, is what sets Huawei apart from both Western startups and traditional OEMs. It’s not speculative technology — it’s already deployed at scale. That gives me confidence and motivation to contribute.”

As of 2025, I’ve also become a German citizen,
