**connect the dots** so it flows like a natural, spoken self-introduction in an interview, while still touching on *all* your key messages: background, professional skills, entrepreneurial journey, Sino-German “bridge-builder,” technology scouting, trend analysis, geopolitical awareness, AI, and even German business etiquette/Wall Street perspective.

* 让骄傲的欧洲人低头不是件容易的事
* 去年我跟我朋友一起经营公司“Poppe Mechatronik”，我们在backnang租了厂房，主营电路板设计，电磁干扰检测、工业3D打印、实验测试台开发（大学的项目）之类的。目前为止我们自己开发了一些产品，活性炭空气净化器、自动化控制温湿度的植物温室、凸轮轴测试台，还有一个电动工具数据记录器。经营得有些吃力，因为我们都没创业经验，也缺乏必要的资源，也想找一些公司合作，只是结果不甚理想，盈利寥寥。因此，长远看，我还是觉得在一家成熟的企业里有针对性地发挥我的能力比较靠谱。不过创业经历也不是一无是处，在过程中我也的确积累了一些实践经验，也能独立做项目。 
这个月我本来已经通过Esslingen大学的面试了，是一个relegung实验室的助理岗，后来大学告诉我，德国有一个exportkontrolle（出口限制政策），我读本科的哈工大在制裁名单上，所以我不能去德国大学工作。
我当然也申请了其他公司，估计下周还能收到一些回应，你回复得快。
* 我那时在flex遇到这个朋友，他也是机电硕士，经不住朋友的劝说+诱惑，选择辞职创业，然后情况就有些失控了。抛开大环境不说，德国经济其实也不行，我的性格也不适合创业，我更适合按部就班地在公司里上班，规则越明确越好。
* 这不就是项目管理吗，我工作七八年了这属于基本技能，在flex时也独立管理过项目，可以的。如果方便的话，这家公司产品相关的东西给我看看，我需要时间研究熟悉技术方面的内容，毕竟每个产品包含的技术点不一样，面试时也得有话说。
* 资源，人脉的精确匹配
* 逆向思维
* 搜十家公司，每家公司写两万字的报告，包括：这家公司所有公开的信息，财报，产品，这家公司LinkedIn的员工，组织架构，并按研发能力进行排行
* 一般来说学校也在积极地寻找跟企业的合作  KIT (RESEARCH TO BUSINESS - technology transfer and innovation newsletter)
* 那個時候我突然意識到，金錢、實體資產有價值，而人與人之間的鏈接啊，同樣很有價值，這可以稱為社會資產。你能連接到的人越多，你就能創造越大的價值。


* 把两个falkutat的教授名单拉出来，里面一半的人我都上过课、能说上话，right？

* 总结王路飞的三个视频的核心观点，商业+ai=xxxx

+ (udacity) create Business ai agent 

so i think currently we are undergo the ai shock, no business, no industry can survive without ai. the first thing i would do if I'm hired for this position is probably to write a Workflow and design a ai agent for each step, or example using agent kit from openai. because whoever does not adopt ai is doomed to be a loser, ai could possibly change business model

**Interview Self-Introduction (Full Story)**

so I’ve lived and worked in Germany for eight years now, studied at Karlsruhe and worked at FLEX, and yeah, I feel like I am rooted in germany both personally and professionally. before I came to germany I have worked in China for four years, at Hella and at FAW; early on i have started to work in the environment of Sino-German joint venture ， there is lot of company like that, usually an international team with mixed background from different culture, either it's a german company with chinese ties or chinese company with german ties. (faway jointed with hella, flex jointed with chervon, baolong and huf sens and so on) So I have independently managed and steered international projects end-to-end, build consensus among diverse stakeholders, and keep projects on track. I am also used to connect german engineering methodologies with precision and tech ecosystem with Chinese organization mindset and supply chain and rapid speed of innovation and whatnot. Let me illustrate with an example, so at flex I was in partly charge of the development of lawn mower robot (the robot running in field and cutting grass), and I have done my research and connected with a startup in stuttgart, specializing in advanced LiDAR technology for autonomous driving, a promising but complex and unproven area, so I led the 'reality check' on their core technology. This involved a deep dive into their technical documentation, reviewing their patent portfolio, conducting in-depth interviews with their engineering team, and hands-on evaluation of their prototypes embedded into our robot prototype. I organized management visits, handled quotation and technical discussions, and structured the whole collaboration. and in the end everything works just as expected and we agreed to accept their offer and embedded their navigation module for autonomous driving into our lawn mower robot. And another example while I was tracking the Battery Regulation in europe and noticed a trend in china in using AI for validation. so I ran feasibility study and offer solutions to my chinese colleagues to reduce failure rates and keep compliant. and occationally in case of an emergency I utilized my alumni connections to link our R&D team with university labotory to do some advanced tests on our power tools. so I always call myself as a *bridge-builder* because I often acted as a cultural and technical translator, I’d describe this skill as structural communication and information integration, which probably align with this position, I think I am capable of connecting Europe’s tech ecosystem with Huawei’s cutting-edge technology. 

another skills I have built over the years Through my studies and professional roles, no less as a hobby, to put in a formal pharse is the so-called **technology scouting and network building**, so if you go to places you meet people right, and I believe people are the best assets. I’ve cultivated some contacts and maintained in more or less a personal relationship, like the professor who tutored my master thesis, whom I still write to once in a while, talking about the new trends of technology, and my old boss and colleagues, some I call friends. So if you count my alumni from university and linkedIn connections then I have a networks with 2/300 people. they are not my close friends but I am sure if I write emails or call in a polite way half of them would respond. I would immediately leverage this network for scouting and possible management visits.

at the moment together with my boyfriend we have set up a small start-up workshop in Backnang, and we also like to seek other Entrepreneurs, mostly Stuttgart-based, offline we like to engage at trade fairs like IAA Mobility in münchen and VDI congresses, we do research in online platforms like Crunchbase for other startups, I also like to attend tech-talks—sometimes when a CEO gives a talk, it’s more informative than any business chart. It's all very interesting. 

Although the business side is not very exciting, it's more of a learning journey than a commercial success, but there is so much to learn from a failure not less than success. it gave me valuable experience: taking full ownership of projects, managing  resources, building connections, and developing solutions from concept to prototype. we have many **3D printers** in house; we built an **industrial 3D printer** by ourselves which can print large parts like furniture. and we set up a small **electrical laboratory** and acquired some lab equipment, like **spectrum analyzer** and **oscilloscope** **signal generator** **power station**, a **CNC machine**, and a **soldering station** we can carry out basic **measurements and do analyses on sensors and actuators**, like **electromagnetic interference tests**, and PCB design and 3D construction, and build prototypes like an automated greenhouse and a camshaft test bench.

another thing of mine, much like a hobby is tracking business news, regulations, and geopolitical shifts. like what's new in business world, what happens recently in syllicon vally, any coperate takeovers, I also have a personal interest for, to quote from the job description, **trend analysis and feasibility “reality checks.”**  I have my own sets of criteria for evaluating a company’s growth potential: technology, data, and innovation. Just as Wall Street analysts do due diligence on investments, I do my own technical and strategic due diligence on new technologies. because it’s not just about spotting exciting technologies, it’s more about asking: are they feasible, scalable, and compliant? and I also have adopted AI tools in my daily workflow and make information flows faster. In my opinion one of the criterias to evaluate a company is to see if they integrate AI models into their internal systems and business processes, and Huawei is a clear **frontrunner** here.

Of course, feasibility is not only technical. It’s also geopolitical. I’ve personally experienced political barrier recently: last month, I was offered a position at Hochschule Esslingen at their regelungtechnik lab and I am supposed to start from october, but due to Germany’s export control policy linked to my undergraduate university in china, which is in the sanction list, they retrieve the offer last minute and I was told I am not allowed to work for any german university or hochschule. Which is kind of against the german law of anti-discrimination. I started the legal process but is dead end. That was purely political, nothing about my competence, but it gave me first-hand awareness of how non-technical risks can affect one's career and in some cases companies too. so I understand Huawei’s position very well. It is both a national champion driving Chinese tech self-reliance and a company operates under intense Western **scrutiny**. so we need to take this unique perspective and indentify political risk early on develop strategies to naigate them smartly so that our roadmaps are both innovative and resilient, and always keep an eye on issues like export controls, GDPR changes, semiconductor export controls, or EU certification processes.

so every chinese definately know huawei, and what I know about Huawei is its **unique strengths**, it's a technology leading company in lots of aspects, it has massive R&D investment — nearly 21% of revenue in 2024; over 240,000 patents, global leadership in 5G; and an automotive business that grew fourfold last year. The **ADS Qiankun system** is already deployed in over 22 production models, and the **HarmonyOS cockpit** combined with 5G-V2X gives Huawei an ecosystem advantage that few others can match. I see Huawei as a true orchestrator in the automotive value chain, not just a Tier 1 supplier.  if I were to take this role at your lab, I would start to actively build strategy to approach the potential company and targeting particular personel to build business relationship. From my perspective, Huawei's potentials in europe-China links promises scouting high-value trends like L3 autonomy, which has immediate roadmap value.

so I think I fit into this role because it aligns with my skills: scouting emerging technologies, analyzing trends, and building strategic cooperations. Maybe I need a bit time to become an expert in this, public relations and resource integration,  scouting. but I believe I have unique qualities, In the current time of artificial intelligence, many skills like data processing and information searching are being outperformed by AI, but some remain irreplaceable, like creativity and particularly empathy and the ability to understand and connect with other people, and instinct, which I believe is crucial for the “reality checks” in technology planning. so the most common practice is to first colaberate on some projects, which involves a deep dive into their technical documentation, reviewing their patent portfolio, conducting in-depth interviews with their engineering team, and assessing the maturity of their technology, its scalability, potential integration risks with existing systems, in this way we get to make a well informed decision and mitigate the investment risk and ensure a more robust path to commercialization. if everything goes fine we come up with a detailed technical feasibility report with critical insights, and finally we structure the acquicision/partnership agreement to include joint research and development effort.

so, to sum up, I have dual perspective, I understand both the German way of doing business and the Chinese way. I have substantial Sino-German project experience and a german network, and also technical expertise in mechatronics, and I believe I can contribute to your team, in tasks like scouting high-potential technologies, conducting feasibility checks, building the right partnerships with European companies, even building innovative and resilient roadmap, and to strengthen Huawei’s position in Europe. and I would like to apply these skills and my engineering expertise in a structured and meaningful way, so to join Huawei is very much the right way, I get to combine my own growth and coincide with the long-term goals of an innovative and well established company. this is quite exciting.

1. At the moment, I’m working independently together with a colleague. We’ve rented a small workshop here in Backnang. Most of our work involves **3D printers** — right now, we’re building an **industrial 3D printer** with a large build volume for printing big parts like furniture components.

2. We’ve also set up a small **electronics lab** and got some equipment, so we can do **basic measurements and analyses on sensors and actuators**. We’ve got stuff like a **spectrum analyzer**, **oscilloscope** (for checking **electromagnetic interference**), **signal generator**, **power supply**, **CNC machine**, and a **soldering station**.

3. Occasionally, we get projects from clients — for example, from Heilbronn University. We’re developing **test benches**, like one for **surface and horn measurement of camshafts** — my colleague mainly handles that part.

4. I also develop **test stations for mechatronic systems**. For example, I designed a test setup for a **DDS Axle Load Sensor**, which is a **Hall-based sensor** that measures **position and pressure** in real time — basically the **axle load through suspension deformation**.
   Since these sensors can become **inaccurate under extreme environmental conditions** (like temperature fluctuations from -20°C to +80°C), we need to run tests and perform **root cause analyses**. I’ve written MATLAB scripts for data analysis and developed an **AI-assisted validation tool** to detect patterns and make predictions.

5. In parallel, I’m also working with **ROS** and building **robot arms** — that’s something I started back when I was at **KIT**.

6. Every now and then, **private customers** drop by with devices for repair. We run some tests and fix the electronics.

7. Before that, I was at **FLEX**, working in development. I contributed to several products and built a **prototype of an autonomous lawn mower**, mostly focusing on the software side.

8. I’ve done a lot of work on **motor control systems** — which is the key part in **power tool design**, like **cordless orbital sanders with variable speed control**.
   Basically, there are three main types:

   * The simplest type **has no feedback**, using **open-loop PWM signals**, like in **leaf blowers, chainsaws, or garden shears**, where precision isn’t critical.

9. Then there are systems **with feedback**, using **Hall sensors** for **closed-loop torque and speed control**. These are used in tools that need **higher precision**, like **drills, grinders, or polishers**.

10. The most advanced form is **field-oriented control (FOC)** — that’s used in **autonomous lawn mowers**.

11. I also do a lot of **testing** — things like **electrical and mechanical performance, vibration and noise levels, temperature tests, durability, and reliability**.
    I perform **FMEA analyses**, prepare **technical documentation for CE certifications**, and write **reports according to ISO standards**.

12. I also build **test setups**. One example was the **validation of a cordless grinder**:
    It includes **pressure and inductive Hall sensors** to measure the **motor’s rotational speed**. Under **heavy load**, **overheating** can occur, making the sensors **unstable**, which leads to **automatic shutdowns**.
    I ran tests to find the **root cause** — for example, **dust buildup in the ventilation**, causing heat accumulation, or **PCB design issues**, where **heat-generating components (like MOSFETs)** were placed too close to the sensor, leading to **thermal drift**.
    To solve such problems, I run **DV (Design Verification)** and **PV (Product Validation)** tests, create **test procedures**, and do **data analysis with MATLAB and Python**.

13. During testing, I came up with an idea:
    Important parameters like **temperature, current, voltage, and speed** are usually recorded manually — which is tedious.
    So I thought about collecting that data **automatically** using a **data logger**. It’s basically an interface between the battery and the machine that automatically records, analyzes, visualizes, and stores the data.
    The prototype can even be built into real products to collect **live operational data**. With enough data, we can **further optimize the motor control parameters**.

14. On the side, I also support **smaller projects** — like **battery testing, EMC tests**, and help with **prototype manufacturing and certification** in cooperation with external labs.

15. Before that, I worked at **HELLA**, where I was responsible for **CAD drawings** and for checking **design plans** according to standards before release.

16. I also worked in **process planning** for headlight production lines — where I gained experience in **PLC programming, electrical schematics, and troubleshooting**, mainly using **Siemens TIA**.

(deutsch)

Hier ist die Übersetzung ins Deutsche (im Stil einer strukturierten Selbstvorstellung für ein Interview):

Ich lebe und arbeite nun seit acht Jahren in Deutschland, habe in Karlsruhe studiert und war bei FLEX beschäftigt. Daher fühle ich mich sowohl privat als auch beruflich in Deutschland verwurzelt. Bevor ich nach Deutschland kam, habe ich vier Jahre lang in China gearbeitet, bei Hella und FAW. Schon früh habe ich in einem Umfeld von chinesisch-deutschen Joint Ventures gearbeitet, davon gibt es viele: meist internationale Teams mit gemischtem kulturellem Hintergrund, sei es ein deutsches Unternehmen mit chinesischen Verbindungen oder umgekehrt (Beispiele sind Faway-Hella, Flex-Chervon, Baolong-Huf Sens usw.). In diesen Rollen habe ich eigenständig internationale Projekte von Anfang bis Ende gesteuert, den Konsens zwischen diversen Akteuren hergestellt und Projekte zuverlässig vorangetrieben. Ich bin daran gewöhnt, deutsche Ingenieurmethodik und technische Präzision mit chinesischer Organisationsmentalität, Lieferkette und hoher Innovationsgeschwindigkeit zu verknüpfen.

Ein Beispiel: Bei FLEX war ich mitverantwortlich für die Entwicklung eines Mähroboter-Prototyps und habe für das Navigationssystem Verbindung zu einem Stuttgarter Start-up aufgenommen, das sich auf fortschrittliche LiDAR-Technologie spezialisiert hat – ein komplexes, vielversprechendes, aber noch unerprobtes Feld. Ich habe eine umfassende Technik- und Patentanalyse durchgeführt, Gespräche mit dem Entwicklungsteam geführt und deren Prototypen in unser System integriert und evaluiert. Ich organisierte Management-Besuche, betreute Angebotserstellung und technische Abstimmung und strukturierte die gesamte Zusammenarbeit. Am Ende funktionierte alles wie geplant, wir entschieden uns für das Start-up, und das Navigationsmodul wurde in unsere Mähroboter integriert.

Ein weiteres Beispiel: Bei FLEX habe ich die europäischen Batterieregulierungen verfolgt und eine Entwicklung beobachtet, dass in China KI zur Validierung eingesetzt wird. Ich habe eine Machbarkeitsstudie durchgeführt und meinen chinesischen Kollegen Lösungen angeboten, um Ausfallraten zu reduzieren und die Einhaltung der Vorschriften zu sichern. In Notfällen habe ich auch mein Alumni-Netzwerk genutzt, um unsere F&E-Teams mit Hochschullabors zwecks spezieller Tests zu verbinden. Daher sehe ich mich selbst als „Brückenbauer“, da ich oft die Rolle eines kulturellen und technischen Übersetzers einnehme. Diese Fähigkeit – strukturierte Kommunikation und Informationsintegration – ist aus meiner Sicht sehr relevant für diese Position, da ich überzeugt bin, dass ich Europas Tech-Ökosystem optimal mit Huaweis führender Technologie verknüpfen kann.

Eine weitere Stärke, die ich in den letzten Jahren durch Studium, Beruf und eigenes Interesse aufgebaut habe, ist das sogenannte Technologie-Scouting und Netzwerken. Auf Konferenzen, Fachmessen oder Online-Plattformen wie Crunchbase habe ich viele Kontakte geknüpft und gepflegt – Professoren, Kollegen, Vorgesetzte, teils sind daraus persönliche Freundschaften entstanden. Zähle ich Alumni und LinkedIn-Kontakte zusammen, komme ich auf ein Netzwerk von 200-300 Kontakten. Sie sind nicht alle eng, aber ich bin sicher, dass bei einer höflichen Anfrage etwa die Hälfte reagieren würde. Dieses Netzwerk würde ich gezielt für Scouting und Kooperationsanbahnungen einsetzen.

Zurzeit betreibe ich mit meinem Partner eine kleine Start-up-Werkstatt in Backnang, suche auch Kontakt zu anderen Unternehmern (meist Raum Stuttgart). Offline nehme ich an Messen wie der IAA Mobility in München oder VDI-Kongressen teil, online recherchiere ich über Plattformen wie Crunchbase zu Start-ups. Auch Tech-Talks von CEOs finde ich oft sehr aufschlussreich.

Zwar ist die wirtschaftliche Seite unseres Start-ups im Moment eher als Lernreise denn als Geschäftserfolg zu sehen, doch man lernt aus Fehlern mindestens so viel wie aus Erfolgen. Ich habe wertvolle Erfahrungen gesammelt – zum Beispiel Projekte von der Idee bis zum Prototypen eigenverantwortlich umzusetzen, Ressourcen einzuteilen, Lösungen zu entwickeln und ein funktionierendes Netzwerk aufzubauen. Wir haben zahlreiche **3D-Drucker**; einen **Industrie-3D-Drucker** für großformatige Teile wie Möbel selbst gebaut, ein kleines **Elektrolabor** mit **Spektrumanalysator**, **Oszilloskop**, **Signalgenerator**, **Netzgerät**, **CNC-Fräse** und **Lötstation** eingerichtet, messen und analysieren an Sensoren und Aktuatoren (u.a. EMV), entwickeln Leiterplatten und Prototypen wie ein automatisiertes Gewächshaus und einen Nockenwellenteststand.

Ein weiteres Hobby ist für mich die Beobachtung von Wirtschaftsnachrichten, Regularien und geopolitischen Entwicklungen, zum Beispiel Neuigkeiten aus dem Silicon Valley, Firmenübernahmen. Besonders interessiert mich – wie auch in Ihrer Stellenanzeige gefordert – **Trendanalyse und Machbarkeitsstudien (Reality Checks)**. Meine Kriterien zur Bewertung des Entwicklungspotenzials eines Unternehmens sind: Technologie, Daten und Innovationskraft. Ganz wie Investment-Analysten an der Wall Street betreibe ich meine eigene technische und strategische Due Diligence: Sind Innovationen realistisch, skalierbar, regelkonform? Ich habe Künstliche Intelligenz aktiv in meinen Arbeitsalltag integriert, um Informationsprozesse zu beschleunigen. Einer meiner Bewertungspunkte ist: Verankert das Unternehmen KI in interne Systeme und Geschäftsprozesse? Huawei ist hier ein klarer **Vorreiter**.

Machbarkeit ist nicht nur technisch; ich habe selbst politische Barrieren erfahren: Im letzten Monat erhielt ich ein Stellenangebot der Hochschule Esslingen für das Labor für Regelungstechnik, das aber wegen der deutschen Exportkontrolle und weil meine chinesische Universität auf der Sanktionsliste steht, kurzfristig zurückgezogen wurde – laut deutschem Antidiskriminierungsgesetz zwar fragwürdig, aber juristisch durchsetzbar. Dieses Erlebnis hat mir vor Augen geführt, wie nichttechnische Risiken eine Karriere und durchaus auch Unternehmen beeinflussen können. Insofern verstehe ich Huaweis Position sehr gut – das Unternehmen ist sowohl ein Aushängeschild für Chinas technologische Eigenständigkeit als auch Ziel westlicher **Sanktionen und Prüfungen**. Deshalb halte ich es für essenziell, solche Risiken frühzeitig zu identifizieren und smarte Strategien zu deren Steuerung zu entwickeln, damit Roadmaps sowohl innovativ als auch widerstandsfähig bleiben – stets im Blick: Exportkontrollen, DSGVO, Vorschriften zu Halbleitern und EU-Zertifizierungsprozesse.

Huawei ist in China jedem bekannt. Was ich konkret über Huawei weiß: Die Firma hat **einzigartige Stärken** – führend in vielen technologischen Bereichen, mit enormen F&E-Investitionen (2024 fast 21% des Umsatzes), über 240.000 Patenten, globaler 5G-Führerschaft, einem Automotive-Geschäft, das sich im Vorjahr vervierfacht hat. Das **ADS Qiankun-System** läuft bereits in über 22 Serienmodellen, das **HarmonyOS**-Cockpit in Kombination mit 5G-V2X verschafft Huawei einen Ökosystemvorteil, dem nur wenige etwas entgegensetzen können. Huawei wird so eher Orchestrator der automobilen Wertschöpfung als "nur" Tier-1-Lieferant. Würde ich die Stelle bei Ihnen antreten, würde ich von Beginn an aktiv Strategie aufbauen, potenzielle Zielunternehmen analysieren, gezielt Kontakte aufbauen – besonders im Hinblick auf Europas China-Verbindungen, z.B. L3-Autonomie als Trend mit unmittelbarem Roadmap-Wert.

Ich finde, das passt sehr gut zu meinen Kompetenzen: Scouting neuer Technologien, Trendanalyse, Aufbau strategischer Partnerschaften. Vielleicht brauche ich etwas Zeit, um Experte zu werden, z.B. im Bereich Öffentlichkeitsarbeit oder Ressourcen-Scouting; aber ich bringe Qualitäten mit, die wesentlich sind, denn im Zeitalter der KI werden viele Fähigkeiten wie Datenverarbeitung von KI übernommen, doch Kreativität, Empathie, Instinkt und die Fähigkeit, andere Menschen einzuschätzen, bleiben einzigartig – sie sind entscheidend für belastbare "Reality Checks" bei der Technologieplanung. In der Praxis heißt das, in Projektkooperationen einen Deep Dive in die Technik, Patente und Interviews mit Entwicklerteams zu machen und Integration, Skalierbarkeit und Risiken gründlich zu überprüfen – damit Investitionen gut abgesichert und Partnerschaften robust gemacht werden. Am Ende steht ein fundierter Machbarkeitsbericht, der als Grundlage für Akquisition und Kooperation dient, z.B. auch für gemeinsame F&E.

Zusammengefasst: Ich habe eine doppelte Perspektive und verstehe sowohl die deutsche als auch die chinesische Geschäftswelt. Ich verfüge über substanzielle chinesisch-deutsche Projekterfahrung, über ein belastbares Netzwerk und tiefgehende Fachexpertise in der Mechatronik – und ich bin überzeugt, dass ich zum Erfolg Ihres Teams beitragen kann: ob beim Scouting von Schlüsseltechnologien, Realitätschecks, Aufbau strategischer Partnerschaften, Entwicklung innovativer Roadmaps oder zur Stärkung von Huaweis Position in Europa. Ich würde meine Fähigkeiten und ingenieurtechnische Expertise gerne in strukturierter Form bei Ihnen einbringen – das passt ideal zu meinem persönlichen Wachstum und zu den langfristigen Zielen Ihres innovativen Unternehmens. Das ist wirklich spannend.

1. Momentan arbeite ich zusammen mit meinem Kollegen selbstständig. Wir haben hier in Backnang eine kleine Werkstatt gemietet. Meistens arbeiten wir mit **3D-Druckern** – gerade basteln wir an einem **Industrie-3D-Drucker** mit großem Bauraum, um auch größere Teile wie Möbelstücke drucken zu können.

2. Wir haben außerdem ein kleines **elektrisches Labor** eingerichtet und ein paar Geräte besorgt – damit kann man **Messungen und Analysen an Sensoren und Aktuatoren** machen. Also so Sachen wie **Spektrumanalysator**, **Oszilloskop** (für **elektromagnetische Störungen**), **Signalgenerator**, **Netzgerät**, **CNC-Maschine** und **Lötstation** sind da am Start.

3. Ab und zu bekommen wir auch Aufträge, zum Beispiel von der Hochschule Heilbronn. Da entwickeln wir **Versuchsstände**, aktuell z. B. einen **Teststand zur Oberflächen- und Hupenvermessung von Nockenwellen** – den Teil übernimmt meistens mein Kollege.

4. Ich selbst entwickle auch **Teststationen für mechatronische Systeme**. Zum Beispiel hab ich einen Testaufbau für einen **DDS Axle Load Sensor** gebaut – das ist ein **Hall-basierter Sensor**, der **Position und Druck** in Echtzeit misst, also die **Achslast über die Federungsverformung**.
   Weil die Sensoren bei **extremen Bedingungen** (z. B. -20 °C bis +80 °C) manchmal **ungenau messen**, muss man Tests und **Root-Cause-Analysen** machen. Dafür hab ich MATLAB-Skripte geschrieben, um die Daten auszuwerten, und ein **KI-gestütztes Validierungstool** gebaut, das Muster erkennt und Vorhersagen machen kann.

5. Parallel arbeite ich weiter mit **ROS** und bastle an **Roboterarmen** – das Projekt hab ich damals am **KIT** angefangen.

6. Ab und zu kommt auch mal ein **Privatkunde** vorbei, bringt Geräte zur Reparatur, und dann machen wir Tests und reparieren die Elektronik.

7. Davor war ich bei **FLEX** in der Entwicklung. Da hab ich an mehreren Produkten mitgearbeitet und unter anderem einen **Prototyp für einen autonomen Rasenmäher** gebaut – hauptsächlich im Software-Bereich.

8. Besonders viel hab ich mit **Motorsteuerungen** gearbeitet – das ist ja der wichtigste Teil bei **Elektrowerkzeugen**, zum Beispiel bei **Akku-Exzenterschleifern mit variabler Drehzahlregelung**.
   Grundsätzlich gibt’s da drei Arten:

   * Die einfachste ist **ohne Feedback**, also **PWM-Signale im offenen Regelkreis** – das findet man z. B. bei **Laubbläsern, Kettensägen oder Gartenscheren**, wo’s auf Präzision nicht so ankommt.

9. Dann gibt’s Systeme **mit Feedback**, also z. B. mit **Hallsensoren**, wo man eine **geschlossene PWM-Drehmoment- und Drehzahlregelung** hat. Das wird bei Werkzeugen mit **höheren Genauigkeitsanforderungen** eingesetzt, etwa bei **Bohrmaschinen, Schleifern oder Polierern**.

10. Und die fortschrittlichste Variante ist die **feldorientierte Regelung** – die kommt z. B. bei **autonomen Rasenmähern** zum Einsatz.

11. Ich mach auch viele **Tests** – also **elektrische und mechanische Leistung, Vibrationen, Geräuschpegel, Temperatur, Dauer- und Zuverlässigkeitstests**. Außerdem mach ich **FMEA-Analysen**, schreib **technische Dokumentationen für CE-Zertifizierungen** und **Berichte nach ISO-Norm**.

12. Ich entwickle auch **Testaufbauten**. Ein Beispiel war die **Validierung eines Akku-Schleifers**:
    Da sind **Druck- und induktive Hallsensoren** integriert, um die **Motordrehzahl** zu messen. Unter **hoher Belastung** kann’s da zu **Überhitzung** kommen, wodurch die Sensoren **instabil** werden – dann schaltet das Gerät automatisch ab.
    Ich hab dann Tests gemacht, um den **Root Cause** zu finden – z. B. ob sich **Staub in der Belüftung sammelt**, oder ob’s am **PCB-Design** lag (wenn z. B. MOSFETs zu nah am Sensor sitzen → **thermische Drift**).
    Um solche Probleme zu lösen, macht man dann **DV- (Design Verification)** und **PV-Tests (Product Validation)**, erstellt **Prüfabläufe** und macht **Datenanalyse mit MATLAB und Python**.

13. Dabei kam mir auch eine Idee:
    Während der Tests muss man ständig Parameter wie **Temperatur, Strom, Spannung oder Drehzahl** manuell mitschreiben – total nervig.
    Also hab ich die Idee gehabt, das Ganze **automatisch zu erfassen** – mit einem **Datalogger**. Das ist eine Schnittstelle zwischen Akku und Maschine, die automatisch Daten aufnimmt, auswertet, grafisch darstellt und speichert.
    Der Prototyp kann sogar direkt in echte Geräte eingebaut werden, um **Live-Daten im Betrieb** zu sammeln. Mit genug Daten kann man dann die **Motorsteuerung noch weiter optimieren**.

14. Nebenbei begleite ich auch **kleinere Projekte**, z. B. **Batterieprüfungen**, **EMV-Tests** und unterstütze bei **Prototypenfertigung und Zertifizierung** mit externen Laboren.

15. Vorher war ich bei **HELLA**, dort war ich für **CAD-Zeichnungen** zuständig und hab **Konstruktionspläne** nach Standards geprüft, bevor sie freigegeben wurden.

16. Außerdem hab ich in der **Prozessplanung** für Scheinwerfer-Produktionslinien mitgearbeitet – dabei hab ich Erfahrung mit **SPS-Programmierung, Stromlaufplänen und Fehlersuche** gesammelt, hauptsächlich mit **Siemens TIA**.

*  while at FLEX I optimized DV/PV testing and introduced AI-assisted validation that cut failure rates by 15%.
For example, at Hella I aligned German ISO 26262 standards with Chinese production requirements for the Audi A6 headlamp project. At FLEX, which is part of a Chinese group, I optimized DV/PV testing and even introduced AI-assisted validation, which cut failure rates by 15%.

of course I am a technical person so my main role is engineer, and I have done tons of technical work, (...项目介绍 ) 

 our topics are very broad, mechatronics, sensortechnik dataanalyse processoptimization ..  We focused on circuit board design, EMI testing, and developed prototypes such as an automated greenhouse and a camshaft test bench. It wasn’t a big commercial success, but it was a great learning journey that gave me valuable experience in taking full ownership of projects, managing resources, and building solutions from concept to prototype.





3. I also develop **test stations** for **mechatronic systems**. For example, we once received an order from HS Heilbronn, where I designed a test setup for a **DDS axle load sensor**, a **Hall-based** sensor capable of real-time measurement of **position and pressure**, specifically the axle load caused by the deformation of the suspension. Because these sensors can **provide inaccurate readings under extreme environmental conditions (e.g., temperature fluctuations from -20°C to +80°C)**, tests and **root-cause analyses** are necessary. I wrote MATLAB scripts for data analysis and developed an AI-powered validation tool to detect patterns in the data and make predictions.
4. We also have a few other projects, such as **developing experimental setups and a test stand for measuring the surface profile of camshafts**, although this is mainly handled by my colleague.
5. In parallel, I continue to work with ROS and am tinkering with robotic arms—a project I started at KIT.
6. Occasionally, private customers visit and bring devices for repair; we conduct tests and repair electronics.



1. At FLEX, I worked in development and participated in several products. I built a **prototype for an autonomous lawn mower**, mainly focusing on software.
2. I spent a lot of time on **motor control**, which is also the most important aspect of designing **power tools**, such as **cordless random orbital sanders with variable speed control**. Basically, there are three types: the simplest has no feedback, meaning **PWM signals in open-loop control**, for example, **leaf blowers, chainsaws, or garden shears**—tools with **low accuracy requirements**.
3. Then there are control methods with feedback signals, using a **hall sensor**, so it’s **closed-loop PWM torque and speed control**, which are used in tools with **higher accuracy requirements**, such as **drills, grinders, or polishers**.
4. There’s also a more advanced method, namely **field-oriented control**, which is used in **autonomous lawn mowers**.
5. I also perform many tests, like measuring **electrical power, mechanical power, vibration and noise, temperature, endurance, and reliability**. I conduct **FMEA analyses** and create the **technical documentation for CE certifications and prepare reports according to ISO standards**.
6. I develop **test setups** as well; one concrete example was **validating a battery-powered sander**. It integrates **pressure and inductive hall sensors** to measure the **rotational speed of the motor**. During **heavy load**, **overheating** can occur, making the sensors **unreliable and unstable** and leading to **automatic shutdowns** of the power tool. Then, I run tests to find the **root cause**, whether it’s **dust buildup in the ventilation**, causing heat accumulation, or **PCB design errors** with heat-generating components (e.g., MOSFETs) placed too close to the sensor, causing thermal drift. To solve these problems, it is sometimes necessary to conduct **DV (Design Verification) and PV (Product Validation) tests**, create **test procedures**, and perform **data analysis using MATLAB and Python**. Here’s an example.
7. During these test processes, I had the idea that parameters like **temperature, current, voltage, and rotational speed** are always collected manually. So, I came up with the idea of automatically collecting the data, which led to the **datalogger**—an interface between the battery and the machine. This tool can automatically record, evaluate, graphically display, and save the data for later analysis. The prototype can even be integrated into real products to collect actual working data. The concept is: with enough data, the motor control parameters can be further optimized.
8. Additionally, I also contributed to some small projects, like **battery tests, EMC** evaluations, and supported **prototype manufacturing and certification with external laboratories**.

I should also mention communication. I have my own way of work, usually when I'm dealing with a topic, I would firstly collect as much as information on the topic, and integrate them into my point of view, then I would form my auguments in a structural way to communicate effectively. I use AI tools to help me summarize, structure, and integrate information across projects, and I strongly prefer employers who embrace AI in their business processes. For me, Huawei’s commitment to AI, HarmonyOS, and smart mobility is a big motivation to join.

**Huawei’s Advantages and Why I’m Motivated**
“What excites me about Huawei is its **technical and business strengths** that no other automotive newcomer can match. For example:

* In 2024, Huawei invested **CNY 179.7 billion (USD 25B)** into R&D — **20.8% of revenue**, which shows long-term commitment to innovation.
* The company holds **over 240,000 patents**, including **13,473 in 5G**, making it the world leader.
* The automotive unit’s revenue grew **4x in 2024** and turned profitable for the first time, with a valuation around **$16 billion**.
* Huawei’s **ADS (Qiankun system)** already supports urban autonomous driving, with deployment in **22+ production models** and 23 million components shipped in 2024.
* Its **HarmonyOS cockpit** and **5G-V2X connectivity** create an ecosystem advantage that few competitors can replicate.

This scale, combined with the **asset-light Tier 1 model (“Huawei Inside”)**, is what sets Huawei apart from both Western startups and traditional OEMs. It’s not speculative technology — it’s already deployed at scale. That gives me confidence and motivation to contribute.”

Great 👍 — here’s a **concise 5-minute version** of your self-introduction speech, tailored for first-round or HR screenings. It keeps your key points (background, Sino-German bridge-builder, entrepreneurial spirit, tech scouting, geopolitical awareness, Huawei’s advantages) but trims the details so it flows naturally within 4–5 minutes.
