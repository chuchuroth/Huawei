**Interview Self-Introduction (Full Story)**

Good morning, and thank you very much for this opportunity. My name is Chuchu Xu. I’m an MSc Mechatronics graduate from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and I’ve lived and worked in Germany for more than eight years. As of 2025, I’ve also become a German citizen, so I feel deeply rooted in Europe both personally and professionally.

of course I am a technical person so my main role is engineer, and I have done tons of technical work, (...项目介绍 ) 

My career has always been at the intersection of German engineering precision and Chinese innovation speed. I like to describe myself as a *bridge-builder*—someone who can connect Europe’s vibrant tech ecosystem with Chinese or global R&D organizations. This comes from my background: I’ve worked in Sino-German joint ventures like FAWAY-HELLA, FLEX-Elektrowerkzeuge, and BHsense, where I often acted as both a cultural and technical translator. For example, at Hella I aligned German ISO 26262 standards with Chinese production requirements for the Audi A6 headlamp project. At FLEX, which is part of a Chinese group, I optimized DV/PV testing and even introduced AI-assisted validation, which cut failure rates by 15%.

Alongside my corporate roles, I also co-founded a small start-up in Backnang. We focused on circuit board design, EMI testing, and developed prototypes such as an automated greenhouse and a camshaft test bench. It wasn’t a big commercial success, but it was a great learning journey that gave me valuable experience in taking full ownership of projects, managing resources, and building solutions from concept to prototype. It also showed me clearly that I thrive most in structured environments with strong resources, professional teams, and long-term product goals—which is why I’m eager to join an innovative and established company like Huawei.

Another skill no less as a personal hobby I bring is **technology scouting and network building**. Over the past years, I’ve built a network of more than 50 contacts in Germany—professors at KIT, engineers at Bosch and Siemens affiliates, and founders of Stuttgart-based startups. I use a multi-channel approach: online platforms like Crunchbase, offline engagement at fairs like IAA Mobility and VDI congresses, and of course my alumni network for warm introductions. A concrete example: at FLEX, I connected our R&D team with a Stuttgart sensor startup, which led to a pilot project that boosted our testing efficiency by 20%. I organized management visits, handled IP discussions, and structured the collaboration. I also like to attend tech talks—sometimes a CEO’s talk tells you more about a company’s direction than any PowerPoint or business chart.

A habit of mine is tracking business news, regulations, and geopolitical shifts. like what happens recently in syllicon vally, any coperate takeovers, there is tons of intereting stories in business world, there is a lot to learn from a success story as well as failed ones.  I also have a personal interest for **trend analysis and feasibility “reality checks.”**  I have my own criteria for evaluating a company’s growth potential are: technology, data, and innovation. Just as Wall Street analysts do due diligence on investments, I try to do technical and strategic due diligence on new technologies. At Poppe Mechatronik, I was tracking the EU Battery Regulation and noticed a trend in using AI for validation. I ran a feasibility study in MATLAB and Python that showed a potential 15% reduction in failure rates, which directly influenced our roadmap. At FLEX, I did something similar for sensor longevity testing, which helped shape a three-year plan. I see this skill as directly relevant to technology planning at Huawei—because it’s not just about spotting exciting technologies, it’s about asking: are they feasible, scalable, and compliant? 

Of course, feasibility is not only technical. It’s also geopolitical. And I understand Huawei’s position very well. It is both a national champion driving Chinese tech self-reliance and a company under intense Western scrutiny. I’ve personally experienced political barriers: last month, I passed the interview and was offered a position at Esslingen University’s regelungtechnik lab, but due to Germany’s export control policy linked to my undergraduate university in china, which is in the sanction list, so they retrieve the offer and I am not allowed to work for any german college because of my bacholer university in china. Which is actually against the german law of anti-discrimination. I started the legal process but is dead end. That decision was purely political, not about my competence, but it gave me first-hand awareness of how non-technical risks can affect careers and companies. That perspective allows me to anticipate issues like export controls, GDPR changes for connected cars, or certification delays, and propose strategies to navigate them. How important politics are and how to navigate them smartly.

I should also mention communication. I have my own way of work, usually when I'm dealing with a topic, I would firstly collect as much as information on the topic, and integrate them into my point of view, then I would form my auguments in a structural way to communicate effectively. This sort of skill is built through the years, from real life experince. I use AI tools to help me summarize, structure, and integrate information across projects, and I strongly prefer employers who embrace AI in their business processes. For me, Huawei’s commitment to AI, HarmonyOS, and smart mobility is a big motivation to join.

Finally, I’m someone who understands both the German way of doing business—structured, punctual, direct, formal—and the Chinese pace of innovation. I believe this dual perspective is essential for a company like Huawei to succeed in Europe.

+ Another strength is **trend analysis and reality checks**. I track regulations, business news, and technology shifts to identify risks early.
+ At Poppe Mechatronik, I spotted AI’s role in EU Battery Regulation compliance and proved with MATLAB and Python that we could cut failure rates by 15%.
+ I also understand the **geopolitical challenges Huawei faces**. I personally experienced this when I was offered a position at Esslingen University but was unable to start due to Germany’s export control list. That was purely political, not competence-related, and it gave me valuable awareness of how non-technical risks can affect strategy.

+ What excites me about Huawei is its **unique strengths**: massive R&D investment — nearly 21% of revenue in 2024; over 240,000 patents, including global leadership in 5G; and an automotive business that grew fourfold last year, becoming profitable for the first time. The **ADS Qiankun system** is already deployed in over 22 production models, and the **HarmonyOS cockpit** combined with 5G-V2X gives Huawei an ecosystem advantage that few others can match. I see Huawei as a true orchestrator in the automotive value chain, not just a Tier 1 supplier.

**Trend Analysis and Geopolitical Awareness**
“One of my passions is tracking business news, regulations, and geopolitical shifts. At Poppe Mechatronik, I noticed the EU Battery Regulation’s push for AI validation and used MATLAB and Python to show we could cut failure rates by 15%.

This skill is particularly relevant for Huawei, which operates under **unique geopolitical scrutiny**. I personally experienced this when I was offered a position at Esslingen University’s regulation lab but was blocked due to Germany’s export control list targeting my undergraduate university. It was a political issue, not competence-related. This taught me firsthand how non-technical risks shape business.

That’s why I believe I can help Huawei anticipate and navigate these risks — whether it’s GDPR for connected cars, semiconductor export controls, or EU certification processes.”

**Trend Analysis and Navigating Geopolitical Realities**

 I believe this instinct is crucial for the “reality checks” in technology planning.

At Poppe Mechatronik, for instance, I monitored EU Battery Regulation updates and noticed AI applications in validation. I ran a feasibility study with MATLAB and Python and showed we could reduce failure rates by 15% while staying compliant.

This awareness is particularly relevant for Huawei’s global position. I’ve personally experienced political restrictions: earlier this year, I passed the interview and was offered a position at Esslingen University’s regulation lab, but due to Germany’s export control policy—linked to my undergraduate university—I wasn’t allowed to take it. The decision was political, not about my skills, and it reinforced my awareness of these non-technical barriers. This perspective helps me anticipate risks, like export controls or GDPR changes, and propose strategies so that roadmaps are both innovative and resilient.
