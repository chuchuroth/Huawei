* 你误会了一个事，contacts不一定指私人关系，你一个人哪来那么多私人关系，你领英上的contacts严格来说也算contacts，所以说你有数百个业内人士contacts完全没问题，（well if include my LinkedIn contacts then i have at least 100s, those who would respond to my E-Mail , 50, those who would call me back or give me a personal chat, about 10, people i would call friends like Professor who tutoring my master thesis, my ex boss, and colleagues who have once worked together for some projects, and friends of friends of friends , my Partner was a graduate from Stuttgart uni, so my alumni plus his, about 200 people, and their connections, it's a large Number)



Perfect 👍 — you already have a **rich set of points** that together form a compelling “story.” The challenge is to **connect the dots** so it flows like a natural, spoken self-introduction in an interview, while still touching on *all* your key messages: background, professional skills, entrepreneurial journey, Sino-German “bridge-builder,” technology scouting, trend analysis, geopolitical awareness, AI, and even German business etiquette/Wall Street perspective.

Here’s a **coherent, interview-ready narrative** in a **spoken-language style** (not overly written), integrating everything you listed:

**Interview Self-Introduction (Full Story)**

Good morning, and thank you very much for this opportunity. My name is Chuchu Xu. I’m an MSc Mechatronics graduate from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and I’ve lived and worked in Germany for more than eight years. As of 2025, I’ve also become a German citizen, so I feel deeply rooted in Europe both personally and professionally.

of course I am a technical person so my main role is engineer, and I have done tons of technical work, (...项目介绍 ) 

My career has always been at the intersection of German engineering precision and Chinese innovation speed. I like to describe myself as a *bridge-builder*—someone who can connect Europe’s vibrant tech ecosystem with Chinese or global R&D organizations. This comes from my background: I’ve worked in Sino-German joint ventures like FAWAY-HELLA, FLEX-Elektrowerkzeuge, and BHsense, where I often acted as both a cultural and technical translator. For example, at Hella I aligned German ISO 26262 standards with Chinese production requirements for the Audi A6 headlamp project. At FLEX, which is part of a Chinese group, I optimized DV/PV testing and even introduced AI-assisted validation, which cut failure rates by 15%.

Alongside my corporate roles, I also co-founded a small start-up in Backnang. We focused on circuit board design, EMI testing, and developed prototypes such as an automated greenhouse and a camshaft test bench. It wasn’t a big commercial success, but it was a great learning journey that gave me valuable experience in taking full ownership of projects, managing resources, and building solutions from concept to prototype. It also showed me clearly that I thrive most in structured environments with strong resources, professional teams, and long-term product goals—which is why I’m eager to join an innovative and established company like Huawei.

Another skill no less as a personal hobby I bring is **technology scouting and network building**. Over the past years, I’ve built a network of more than 50 contacts in Germany—professors at KIT, engineers at Bosch and Siemens affiliates, and founders of Stuttgart-based startups. I use a multi-channel approach: online platforms like Crunchbase, offline engagement at fairs like IAA Mobility and VDI congresses, and of course my alumni network for warm introductions. A concrete example: at FLEX, I connected our R&D team with a Stuttgart sensor startup, which led to a pilot project that boosted our testing efficiency by 20%. I organized management visits, handled IP discussions, and structured the collaboration. I also like to attend tech talks—sometimes a CEO’s talk tells you more about a company’s direction than any PowerPoint or business chart.

A habit of mine is tracking business news, regulations, and geopolitical shifts. like what happens recently in syllicon vally, any coperate takeovers, there is tons of intereting stories in business world, there is a lot to learn from a success story as well as failed ones.  I also have a personal interest for **trend analysis and feasibility “reality checks.”**  I have my own criteria for evaluating a company’s growth potential are: technology, data, and innovation. Just as Wall Street analysts do due diligence on investments, I try to do technical and strategic due diligence on new technologies. At Poppe Mechatronik, I was tracking the EU Battery Regulation and noticed a trend in using AI for validation. I ran a feasibility study in MATLAB and Python that showed a potential 15% reduction in failure rates, which directly influenced our roadmap. At FLEX, I did something similar for sensor longevity testing, which helped shape a three-year plan. I see this skill as directly relevant to technology planning at Huawei—because it’s not just about spotting exciting technologies, it’s about asking: are they feasible, scalable, and compliant? 

Of course, feasibility is not only technical. It’s also geopolitical. And I understand Huawei’s position very well. It is both a national champion driving Chinese tech self-reliance and a company under intense Western scrutiny. I’ve personally experienced political barriers: last month, I passed the interview and was offered a position at Esslingen University’s regelungtechnik lab, but due to Germany’s export control policy linked to my undergraduate university in china, which is in the sanction list, so they retrieve the offer and I am not allowed to work for any german college because of my bacholer university in china. Which is actually against the german law of anti-discrimination. I started the legal process but is dead end. That decision was purely political, not about my competence, but it gave me first-hand awareness of how non-technical risks can affect careers and companies. That perspective allows me to anticipate issues like export controls, GDPR changes for connected cars, or certification delays, and propose strategies to navigate them. How important politics are and how to navigate them smartly.

I should also mention communication. I have my own way of work, usually when I'm dealing with a topic, I would firstly collect as much as information on the topic, and integrate them into my point of view, then I would form my auguments in a structural way to communicate effectively. This sort of skill is built through the years, from real life experince. I use AI tools to help me summarize, structure, and integrate information across projects, and I strongly prefer employers who embrace AI in their business processes. For me, Huawei’s commitment to AI, HarmonyOS, and smart mobility is a big motivation to join.

Finally, I’m someone who understands both the German way of doing business—structured, punctual, direct, formal—and the Chinese pace of innovation. I believe this dual perspective is essential for a company like Huawei to succeed in Europe.

In summary: I bring deep German roots, a trilingual profile, proven experience in Sino-German collaborations, an entrepreneurial mindset, and strong skills in technology scouting, trend analysis, and communication. I’m confident I can contribute to Huawei’s Automotive Engineering Lab by scouting high-potential technologies, conducting reality checks, and building the right partnerships to strengthen Huawei’s position in Europe’s automotive ICT ecosystem.

+ I would work on immediately/ what idea I have NOW - 

For my role, Huawei's potentials in EU-China bridges (e.g., via KIT networks) enable scouting high-value trends like L3 autonomy—delivering immediate roadmap value.

## **Concise Interview Speech (5 min)**

Good morning/afternoon, and thank you for this opportunity. My name is Chuchu Xu. I’m an MSc Mechatronics graduate from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology with over eight years of engineering experience in the German automotive industry. I’ve recently become a German citizen, and I see myself as a *bridge-builder* between German engineering precision and Chinese innovation speed — someone who can connect Europe’s tech ecosystem with Huawei’s cutting-edge R&D.

I’ve worked in Sino-German joint ventures like FAWAY-HELLA and FLEX-Elektrowerkzeuge, where I often acted as both a cultural and technical translator. At Hella, I aligned ISO 26262 safety standards with Chinese production demands, while at FLEX I optimized DV/PV testing and introduced AI-assisted validation that cut failure rates by 15%. Alongside this, I co-founded a small start-up, where we developed prototypes like an automated greenhouse and a camshaft test bench. Although more of a learning journey than a commercial success, it gave me valuable experience in project ownership, resource management, and innovation.

One of my strongest assets is **technology scouting and network building**. Over the years, I’ve cultivated more than 50 contacts across Germany — professors, startups, and engineers from companies like Bosch and Siemens affiliates. I combine online tools like Crunchbase with offline activities such as IAA Mobility and alumni introductions. At FLEX, for example, I connected our R&D team with a Stuttgart sensor startup, which led to a pilot project improving testing efficiency by 20%.

Another strength is **trend analysis and reality checks**. I track regulations, business news, and technology shifts to identify risks early. At Poppe Mechatronik, I spotted AI’s role in EU Battery Regulation compliance and proved with MATLAB and Python that we could cut failure rates by 15%. I also understand the **geopolitical challenges Huawei faces**. I personally experienced this when I was offered a position at Esslingen University but was unable to start due to Germany’s export control list. That was purely political, not competence-related, and it gave me valuable awareness of how non-technical risks can affect strategy.

What excites me about Huawei is its **unique strengths**: massive R&D investment — nearly 21% of revenue in 2024; over 240,000 patents, including global leadership in 5G; and an automotive business that grew fourfold last year, becoming profitable for the first time. The **ADS Qiankun system** is already deployed in over 22 production models, and the **HarmonyOS cockpit** combined with 5G-V2X gives Huawei an ecosystem advantage that few others can match. I see Huawei as a true orchestrator in the automotive value chain, not just a Tier 1 supplier.

In short, I bring deep German roots, a trilingual profile, and proven Sino-German collaboration experience. I’m confident I can contribute by scouting technologies, conducting feasibility checks, and building the right partnerships to strengthen Huawei’s position in Europe. And I’d be very glad to discuss how I could apply these strengths to one of your current challenges.
