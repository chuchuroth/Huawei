* 你误会了一个事，contacts不一定指私人关系，你一个人哪来那么多私人关系，你领英上的contacts严格来说也算contacts，所以说你有数百个业内人士contacts完全没问题，（well if include my LinkedIn contacts then i have at least 100s, those who would respond to my E-Mail , 50, those who would call me back or give me a personal chat, about 10, some i have longterm work relationship with and trusted Friends built through the years, people i would call friends like Professor who tutoring my master thesis, my ex boss, and colleagues who have once worked together for some projects, and friends of friends of friends , my Partner was a graduate from Stuttgart uni, so my alumni plus his, about 200 people, and their connections, it's a large Number)
(i am just a regular chinese, I don't have rich parents, I don't have an uncle who works for the party at high rank, i am not in that circle )

* 说实话，如果去掉杀猪盘最后骗钱那一步，那就是非常完美的公关和销售策略，人与人的信任感本就需要时间和耐心慢慢建立
* 为什么我想做这个工作？因为我觉得我有潜力成为公共关系和资源整合scouting方面的专家，并且发挥我的创造力给xx公司创造独一无二的价值，我们处于ai时代，很多能力比如计算能力、信息搜集等方面都逐渐被ai超越，独属于人类且不会被ai取代的能力就是共情力和同理心这些，因此我觉得这份工作对我有额外的吸引力。
