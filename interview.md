**Interview Self-Introduction (Full Story)**



# who am i and who are you

I've lived and worked in Germany for eight years now, studied at KIT in Karlsruhe, worked at FLEX in Steinheim and now im backnang, At the moment me and my friend we have set up a small startup workshop in Backnang, we have registered by government, so we are almost like entreprenuers, not the successful ones. We have many 3D printers in-house; we have built an industrial 3D printer by ourselves which can print large parts like furniture. And we set up a electrical laboratory and acquired some lab equipments, ~~spectrum analyzer and oscilloscope, signal generator, power station, a CNC machine, and a soldering station~~  and can do basic measurements and tests on sensors and actuators, like electromagnetic interference tests, and we do PCB design and 3D construction, and we build prototypes, and we have developed own products like we have a aircleaner and a greenhouse with automated control system and a camshaft test bench already onsale. but revenue is low, which makes me realize what really matters is not producing the product but to sell it. in china we always talk about overcapacity.. ~~and I really feel rooted here both personally and professionally.~~ Before Germany, I worked in china at Hella and FAW, so I started my career early on in the environment of Sino-German joint ventures and I am familiar with the working environment of international team with members from different country —at the time there's a lot of companies like that, usually a german company open a braunch in china, like Hella jointed with faway, FLEX with Chervon, and I know there is many sensor manufacturers like wodeer, and Baolong and Huf's BHsense, and so on, they are all joint ventures. So I've independently managed and steered international projects end-to-end, ~~built consensus among diverse stakeholders, and kept things on track.~~ I'm also used to connecting German engineering methodologies with precision and german tech ecosystem with the Chinese organizational mindset, chinese supply chain, and chinese rapid speed of innovation and whatnot. So I always see myself a bridge-builder because I often acted as a cultural and technical translator, I'd describe this skill as structural communication and information integration, which probably aligns with this position. 

我在德国已经八年了，先再卡鲁读硕士，然后在steinheim的 FLEX 工作，目前在巴克南（Backnang），和我朋友一起注册了一家小公司，在家附近租个便宜的厂房，四舍五入也算是创业者，虽然还在早期阶段。我们有好几台 3D 打印机，并自己手撸了一台工业级 3D 打印机，大概有一个房间那么大，可以打印大件（如家具，塑料桌子椅子）之类的。然后我们搞了一个小型电气实验室，配了一些基础的实验设备，能够进行比较基础的传感器和执行器的测量与测试（包括电磁干扰测试），胎压控制系统传感器，空气质量传感器之类的，还有3D 建模与原型机开发，PCB 设计、。我们还已经推出了几款自己研发的产品，例如活性炭空气净化器，自己设计的外壳，自己打印，一个带自动控制系统的温室(温度，湿度)，以及一款凸轮轴测试台，用来测试发动机的凸轮轴转速，误差是毫秒级，这些已经放在一些零售平台上卖。但是销量不好，这让我意识到，现在这个时代，能把东西造出来不是本事，找到合适的销路，卖得出去才是本事。
在来德国之前，我曾在中国的海拉（Hella）和一汽集团（FAW）工作，从职业早期就处于中德合资企业的环境中，熟悉国际化团队的工作模式。当时有很多类似的合作模式，例如海拉与富维合资、FLEX 与泉峰合作等，我也了解像沃德尔、保隆、Huf BHsense 等中德合资的传感器制造企业。
在工作过程中，也有过几次独立负责并推动相对比较大型的项目的管理，整个流程走了一遍，里面的坑也一个部落踩了一遍，我也比较熟悉如何将德国工程的严谨方法论与技术体系，与中国的组织效率、供应链体系以及快速创新节奏相结合，我负责从中协调，斡旋。我始终把自己定位为“桥梁型人才”，能够在文化与技术层面起到沟通与融合的作用。我称这种能力为“结构化沟通与信息整合”，也正是我认为与该职位最契合的核心优势。

I also did research about you, You hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Tongji University, the best ones in china. You've transitioned from Huawei’s 5G research to the qilin chip architecture platform which is automotive-grade, and then further expanded into the electric vehicle systems field. Now you’re organizing the Automotive Engineering Lab of the IAS BU ( Intelligent Automotive Solution Business Unit ) in Europe, so essentially you have bridged the three core technology domains of communications, chips, and electric vehicles, that is quite profound and outstanding — you’re a technical expert and an interdisciplinary talent and also a leader with vision and strategic insight, you are guiding a team to represent Chinese company in Europe and expand into new territories in a cross-cultural environment. Your foresight and integrative abilities in understanding the industry are far beyond those of your peers. I see we both entered university in 2007, and we’re both from Zhejiang. But you’re far more accomplished than I am. My background is in mechanical engineering so I can do technical drawings and motor design — but I’ve only worked in small factories manufacture components like car lamps and power tool. probably when I’m still just turning screws at production line at FAW Faway, you were already doing 5G Research at Huawei. so It’s truly an honor to have the opportunity to work for you.

我们俩都是2007年考上大学, 而且都是浙江老乡，不过您比我强得多，我的背景是机械/机电，会画图纸也会电机研发，但也就在车灯厂和电动工具厂这些零部件厂工作过，当我还在一汽富维管车间项目时，您就已经在华为5G搞研发了。您是同济计算机博士，您从华为的5G研发转到车规级芯片麒麟芯片架构平台，再横跨到电动车系统, 现在在欧洲主导IAS BU技术布局，相当于把通信、芯片和电动车三大核心技术领域都贯通了，您技术底蕴真是太深厚了，真的是顶尖的跨学科人才。您不仅是技术专家，也是一位非常有战略眼光的管理者，能带着团队在跨文化的环境中代表中国企业在欧洲开疆拓土，您对整个行业的前瞻性判断和整合能力远超同龄人。能跟着您做事情，是我的荣幸。



# PM
_and we also like to seek other entrepreneurs, mostly Stuttgart-based. Offline, we like to engage at trade fairs like IAA Mobility in Munich and VDI congresses; we do research on online platforms like Crunchbase for other startups. I also like to attend tech-talks—sometimes when a CEO gives a talk, it's more informative than any business chart, very interesting. Although the business side of our small startup is not very exciting, it's more of a learning journey than a commercial success; nevertheless, there is so much to learn from a failure not less than success. It gave me valuable experience: Taking full ownership of projects, managing resources, building connections, and developing solutions from concept to prototype._

# FLEX
_Let me illustrate with an example—so at FLEX, I was partly in charge of developing a lawn mower robot, the kind that runs in the field and cuts grass autonomously. I did my research and connected with a startup in Stuttgart specializing in advanced LiDAR technology for autonomous driving—a promising but complex and unproven area. So I led the 'reality check' on their core technology: This involved a deep dive into their technical documentation, reviewing their patent portfolio, conducting in-depth interviews with their engineering team, and hands-on evaluation of their prototypes embedded into our robot prototype. I organized management visits, handled quotations and technical discussions, and structured the whole collaboration. And in the end, everything worked just as expected—we agreed to accept their offer and embedded their navigation module for autonomous driving into our lawn mower robot._

_And another example: While I was tracking the Battery Regulation in Europe and noticed a trend in China using AI for validation, so I ran a feasibility study and offered solutions to my Chinese colleagues to reduce failure rates by 15% and keep us compliant. And occasionally, in case of an emergency, I utilized my alumni connections to link our R&D team with a university laboratory to do some advanced tests on our power tools._



# why i fit for this job
So this job is about scouting, and it requires the ability to precisely match resources and networks. ~~I see connections between people as being just as valuable as money or physical assets—what I'd call social capital. The more people you're able to connect with, the greater the value you can create.~~ So I've built a pretty solid professional network in Germany, mostly through my university and previous work experience. During my studies, I connected with several professors—one of them supervised my master's thesis, and we still stay in touch from time to time, often discussing new trends in technology. I've also kept in contact with my former boss and colleagues, some of whom I'd now call friends. so If I include my university alumni and LinkedIn connections, my network is around two to three hundred people. They're not all close friends, of course, but I'm confident that if I reached out professionally, many would respond. I'd definitely make use of this network right away—for example, to scout opportunities, gather insights, or arrange management visits. 

这个职位主要涉及资源与网络的拓展与匹配，因此需要具备精准识别和对接资源的能力。
在德国这些年，我积累了比较扎实的职业人脉网络，主要来自我的大学和之前的工作经历。
在求学期间，我与几位教授保持了良好的关系，其中一位是我硕士论文的导师，我们至今仍会不时联系，交流一些最新的技术趋势。
此外，我也一直和以前的上司及同事保持联系，其中有些人现在已经成为朋友。
如果算上校友圈和 LinkedIn 上的职业人脉，我目前的网络大概有两三百人。
当然，并不是所有人都非常熟络，但我有信心，如果我以专业的方式联系他们，很多人都会积极回应。
在工作中，我也会充分利用这些人脉资源，比如用于项目机会的拓展、行业信息的收集，或是安排管理层的访问等。

another thing I do often is gathering information. For example, if I need a list of university professors, I would use publicly available information online—such as an institute's exam schedule—to reason backward and identify the complete list of faculty members in that department. And universities are also eager to collaborate with external partners. For example, at the time I was studying at KIT, the mechanical engineering department ran a program called Research to Business, which actively seeks opportunities to cooperate with companies and facilitate technology transfer and innovation implementation. Similarly, if I want to understand the organizational structure of a public company, I make good use of platforms like LinkedIn—I'll pull together a list of the company's current employees and then analyze their roles to piece together how the organization is structured. If I'm particularly interested in a company, I take the time to gather and review all its publicly available information—such as financial reports and product descriptions—and conduct a detailed analysis and assessment of its research and development capabilities.

我平时还经常做的一件事是信息收集。
举个例子，如果我需要整理一份大学教授的名单，我会利用公开的网络信息，比如院系的考试安排，从中反向推理出该系完整的教师名单。
高校本身也非常希望与外部机构合作， 所以是双向奔赴。
比如我在 KIT（卡尔斯鲁厄理工学院）学习时，机械工程学院就有一个叫 “Research to Business” 的项目，专门负责推动与企业的合作，促进科研成果的转化和创新落地。
另外，如果我想了解一家上市公司的组织架构，我会充分利用像 LinkedIn 这样的平台，把公司现任员工的信息整理出来，再通过他们的职位和职责分析，推断出公司的组织结构。
如果我对某家公司特别感兴趣，我还会花时间收集和研读所有公开信息，例如财报、产品介绍等，并对其研发能力进行详细的分析与评估。

Another habit which is much like a hobby, also relevant to this job, is tracking business news, regulations, and geopolitical shifts—like what's new in the business world, what happens recently in Silicon Valley or Wall Street, any corporate takeovers. I also have a personal interest for—to quote from the job description—trend analysis and feasibility 'reality checks.' I have my own sets of criteria for evaluating a company's growth potential: Technology, data, and innovation. Just as Wall Street analysts do due diligence on investments, I do my own technical and strategic due diligence on new technologies, just for fun. and it's not just about spotting exciting technologies; it's more about asking: Are they feasible, scalable, and compliant, right.

我还有一个习惯，也算是兴趣爱好，而且和这个职位也挺相关的，就是关注商业新闻、政策法规以及地缘政治的变化。
我会经常了解商业领域的新动态，比如硅谷或华尔街最近发生了什么、有哪些企业并购案例等等。
我个人也很喜欢做趋势分析和可行性验证——正好和岗位描述里提到的“趋势分析与现实可行性评估（reality checks）”相符。
我自己有一套评估企业成长潜力的标准：技术、数据和创新。
就像华尔街的分析师会对投资项目做尽职调查一样，我也会出于兴趣，对新技术做一些技术层面和战略层面的“尽调”。
不过对我来说，这不仅仅是发现令人兴奋的新技术，更重要的是去思考：这些技术是否真正可行、能否规模化、以及是否符合合规要求。

A little about my work style: When I’m facing a project, I first create a structure and break it down into smaller segments. Then I further divide them into specific tasks, identify the necessary resources or the right people to complete them, and plan one or two weeks ahead. I also have a weekly jour fixe meeting with my supervisor to review progress and adjust priorities.


I'd talk more about my hobby but I don't want to bore you. My favorite Netflix series is House of Cards. I still remember that courtroom scene where Raymond Tusk says, 'Under the Fifth Amendment, I have the right to remain silent.' That line really stuck with me. I've also always been fascinated by Wall Street stories. For example, I once read a book about Steve Cohen, often called the 'Hedge Fund King.' It described how he was suspected of being at the center of a huge insider trading network and how the FBI tried, but ultimately failed, to turn one of his informants—it was a really dramatic story. What struck me most was how the rules can change over time. Back then, insider trading was a serious crime, but since the Trump administration, many of those boundaries have quietly shifted. Actions that once led to convictions have now become almost standard practice in some parts of the industry. That really made me realize how quickly policies and regulations can evolve—and how important it is for professionals like us to stay alert, understand the rules as they change, and make smart, well-judged decisions.

我本来还想多聊聊我的兴趣爱好，但怕说太多让您觉得无聊（笑）。
我最喜欢的 Netflix 剧集是《纸牌屋》（House of Cards）。我印象最深的是一场法庭戏，雷蒙德·塔斯克说了一句：“根据第五修正案，我有权保持沉默。” 那句话让我印象特别深刻。
我一直对华尔街的故事也很感兴趣。比如我曾读过一本关于史蒂夫·科恩（Steve Cohen）的书，他被称为“对冲基金之王”。书中讲到他当年被怀疑是一个庞大内幕交易网络的核心人物，FBI 尝试劝说他的线人作证但最终失败——整个故事非常戏剧性。
让我印象最深的其实不是案件本身，而是“规则的变化”。
在当时，内幕交易是非常严重的犯罪行为，但到了特朗普政府时期，这些界限悄然发生了变化，过去会导致定罪的行为，如今在行业中某些领域已经变得几乎“常态化”。
这让我意识到，政策和法规的变化其实非常迅速。
对于我们这样的职业人士来说，保持警觉、理解规则的变化、并基于最新环境做出理性而明智的判断，真的非常重要。

so as I understand one of the key skills of this job is being able to gather and manage information effectively. In today's world, information is power—it's also a kind of social currency. The people who can access valuable information and know how to interpret it are often the ones who can truly influence others. Of course, getting high-quality or unique information isn't easy—it comes with a cost. That's why it's important to use the right tools. For example, I like to use AI tools to actively search, filter, organize, and analyze information. The idea is to control how you get information, rather than passively accepting whatever the media presents. That way, the insights you gain become more unique and valuable. It's also important to slow down sometimes—to go deeper into a topic, think critically, and form your own perspective. I believe in building a kind of personal feedback loop: Connecting with more people, collecting feedback, learning from different viewpoints, and continuously refining my understanding. Over time, this not only helps me see things more clearly, but also strengthens my influence—people become more open to the ideas I share, which expands my network even further and helps uncover new resources and business opportunities.

在我理解中，这个岗位的核心能力之一就是高效地收集和管理信息。
在当今这个时代，信息就是力量，也是一种“社会资本”。
能够获取有价值信息并准确解读的人，往往才是真正具备影响力的人。
当然，高质量或独特的信息并不容易获得——它是有成本的。
所以，使用合适的工具就非常重要。
比如我个人习惯利用一些 AI 工具来主动搜索、筛选、整理和分析信息。
我的理念是要“主动掌控信息来源”，而不是被动地接受媒体推送的内容。
这样得到的洞察会更加独特，也更有价值。
同时，我认为有时候也要“慢下来”——深入研究某个主题，进行批判性思考，形成自己的观点。
我相信要建立一种个人的信息反馈循环：
不断与更多人交流、收集反馈、吸收不同视角的意见，并持续修正自己的理解。
长久下来，这不仅能让我看问题更全面、更清晰，也能提升自己的影响力。
当别人认可并愿意倾听你的观点时，你的网络会自然扩展，也能进一步发现新的资源与商业机会。

From a broader point of view, I think the way wealth is created is changing. It's no longer just about how big a company is—it's about how well you can connect with people and other parts of the world. The ability to build meaningful connections is becoming the most valuable asset, both for individuals and for organizations. When a company becomes a key connector in its industry, its position strengthens and its transaction costs with the market would cut down naturally, this is expression from economic point of view.

从更宏观的角度来看，我认为财富的创造方式正在发生变化。
它不再仅仅取决于一家公司的规模有多大，而是取决于你能多好地与他人、与世界建立联系。
如今，无论是对个人还是对企业而言，构建有意义的连接，正在成为最有价值的资产。
当一家企业能够在其所在行业中成为关键的“连接者”，它的市场地位会自然增强，
而与外部市场的交易成本也会随之下降——这是从经济学角度来看的一种体现。

# KIT and huawei

~~Building on that,~~ i also did my research, KIT already has some cool ties with Huawei through the AI Talent Training Program at the Institute for Information Management in Engineering—IMI for short—where Huawei donated 100 Ascend kits back in 2020 for hands-on training in deep learning and neural networks, all geared toward Industry 4.0 stuff like AI for robotics. It's this 'Train-the-Trainer' setup, with online sessions since the pandemic, and it fits right into mechatronics work like my thesis on autonomous cranes. And with KIT's new State Graduate Center for AI kicking off this year in Heilbronn—focusing on robotics and cybersecurity—there's even more potential there. For instance, I'd start actionable by reaching out to Prof. Jivka Ovtcharova, the head at IMI (you can find her at jivka.ovtcharova@kit.edu on their site), for instance I could maybe write a quick email proposing a small pilot: Like a workshop using the LGZ (Landesgraduiertenzentrum für angewandte Künstliche Intelligenz) resources to test Huawei's Qiankun ADS on KIT's simulations for ADAS feasibility and technical bottleneck—starting with a 15-minute call, then inviting her to an alumni event in Munich. That way, it's low-key but builds real momentum for scouting.

我也做了一些功课。其实 KIT 和华为之间已经有不错的合作基础。
比如在信息管理与工程研究所（IMI），他们通过人工智能人才培养项目（AI Talent Training Program）开展了合作。早在 2020 年，华为就向该项目捐赠了 100 套 Ascend 开发套件，用于深度学习和神经网络的实操培训，这些内容都和工业 4.0 相关，比如面向机器人应用的人工智能。
这个项目采用的是 “Train-the-Trainer（培训培训者）” 的形式，自疫情以来也一直通过线上课程持续进行。其实它和我之前在自动化起重机方向的论文研究（属于机电一体化领域）非常契合。

此外，KIT 今年在海尔布隆新成立了州级人工智能研究生中心（State Graduate Center for AI），重点方向包括机器人和网络安全，这也带来了更多的合作潜力。
如果是我来推动，我会先从一些可执行的小动作入手，比如联系 IMI 的负责人 Jivka Ovtcharova 教授（她的邮箱在官网上可以找到：jivka.ovtcharova@kit.edu），
我可以先发一封简短的邮件，提议做一个小型的试点，比如利用 LGZ（应用人工智能州级研究生中心）的资源，在 KIT 的自动驾驶仿真环境里测试华为的乾坤 ADS 系统的可行性和技术瓶颈。
从一次 15 分钟的初步沟通开始，再邀请她参加在慕尼黑的校友活动。
这种方式比较低调务实，但能够真正为后续的技术合作和资源对接积累势能。



# why I am searching for job
Of course, feasibility is not only technical. It's also geopolitical. I've personally experienced political issue recently: Last month, I was offered a position at Hochschule Esslingen at their Regelungstechnik lab, and I was supposed to start from October, but due to Germany's export control policy linked to my undergraduate university in China—which is on the sanction list—they retrieved the offer last minute, and I was told I am not allowed to work for any German university or Hochschule. Which is kind of against the German law of anti-discrimination. I started the legal process, but it's a dead end. That was purely political, nothing about my competence, but it gave me first-hand awareness of how political risks can affect one's career and, in some cases, companies too. So I understand Huawei's position very well. It is both a Chinese national self-reliance high-tech champion and a company operating under intense Western scrutiny. So we need to take this unique perspective and identify political risks early on, develop strategies to navigate them smartly, so that our roadmaps could be innovative and resilient, and always keep an eye on issues like export controls, GDPR (europe's General Data Protection Regulation ), semiconductor export controls, or EU certification processes.

当然，项目的可行性不仅仅取决于技术层面，还包括地缘政治因素。
我自己最近其实也亲身经历了一次政治因素带来的影响。
上个月，我原本已经拿到了埃斯林根应用技术大学（Hochschule Esslingen）控制工程实验室的工作邀请，预计十月入职。
但在最后阶段，由于德国的出口管制政策涉及到我本科就读的中国大学（该校在制裁名单上），学校临时撤回了录用决定，并告知我无法在任何德国高校任职。
这在某种程度上与德国的反歧视法律相矛盾。
我尝试通过法律途径解决，但结果并不理想。
这件事与我的能力无关，纯粹是政治层面的原因。
不过，这次经历让我切身体会到——政治风险不仅会影响个人职业发展，也会对企业运营带来现实影响。

正因如此，我非常理解华为目前所处的特殊位置：
既是一家代表中国高科技自主创新的领先企业，同时又在西方环境中承受着高度的外部审视。
所以我认为，我们需要以这种独特的全球视角，及早识别潜在的政治风险，并制定灵活的应对策略，
让公司的技术与业务路线既具有创新性，又具备韧性。
同时，也要时刻关注出口管制、GDPR（欧盟《通用数据保护条例》）、半导体出口限制以及欧盟认证流程等合规议题。

# why huawei, what is huawei advantage 
So huawei is an innovative and well-established company, every Chinese definitely knows Huawei, and what I know about Huawei is its unique strengths—it's a technology-leading company in lots of aspects, it has massive R&D investment, nearly 21% of revenue in 2024; over 240,000 patents, global leadership in 5G; and an automotive business that grew fourfold last year. The ADS Qiankun system is already deployed in over 22 production models, and the HarmonyOS cockpit combined with 5G-V2X gives Huawei an ecosystem advantage that few others can match. I see Huawei as a true orchestrator in the automotive value chain, not just a Tier 1 supplier. so If I were to take this role at your lab, I would start to actively build strategies to approach potential companies and target particular personnel to build business relationships. From my perspective, Huawei's potentials in Europe-China links promise scouting high-value trends like L3 autonomy, which has immediate roadmap value—imagine scaling that via KIT's LGZ for joint AI-driven EV simulations.

华为是一家创新性极强、同时又非常成熟的企业。
几乎每一个中国人都知道华为，而我对华为的了解更多在于它独特的技术优势。
华为在多个领域都处于技术领先地位，研发投入巨大——仅 2024 年研发支出就占到营收的约 21%。
公司目前拥有超过 24 万项专利，在全球 5G 领域处于绝对领先地位；
同时，华为的智能汽车业务去年增长了四倍。
乾坤 ADS 系统已经在 22 款以上的量产车型中落地，
而鸿蒙座舱与 5G-V2X 的结合，更让华为在智能网联生态中具备了少有的系统性优势。
在我看来，华为不仅仅是一家 Tier 1 供应商，更是汽车产业价值链中的系统级整合者（orchestrator）。

如果我有机会加入贵实验室的岗位，我会主动制定策略，去接触潜在的企业合作伙伴，
并有针对性地建立关键业务关系。
从我的视角看，华为在中欧之间的创新联结潜力巨大，
尤其在 L3 级自动驾驶等高价值趋势上，具备直接的技术与市场落地意义。
例如，可以通过与 KIT 的 LGZ 平台合作，利用 AI 驱动的电动车仿真项目，
共同探索更多具有产业化前景的技术路径。

# AI
next I will talk a bit about AI, because it is unavoidable big topic, nowadays AI is revolutionizing and transforming every industry—in the near future, every company will be an AI company and producing tokens (this is a quote from Jesan Huang); for car companies, besides manufacturing cars, it will also have to produce tokens that run in those cars. And Huawei is without any doubt frontrunner here. I suppose Huawei has already integrated AI models into some of its internal systems and business processes and so on. so the first thing I would do if I'd work for huawei is to learn about Huawei's AI strategy and try to build something to integrate into Huawei's workflow as a cohesive subsystem. I have already adopted some AI tools in my daily workflow to help information flow run faster, like Agent-Kit from OpenAI or n8n, and generative AI everyday for sure. ~~So basically, first define the task execution sequence or the workflow; next, set up API integration so that the agent or assistant can access relevant data; lastly, implement some sort of open-source orchestration technology. And I have also attended the Udacity program 'AI for Business,' and learned from a company perspective how new AI tools can be developed, deployed, and integrated into various workflows. I can imagine the result in Huawei is probably a fragmented AI ecosystem where tools exist in silos, and abundant user data may reside in on-premise environments, making coordination, interoperability, and governance increasingly complex in different business scenarios.~~

接下来我想谈一点关于人工智能的话题，因为这是一个无法回避的大主题。
如今，AI 正在重塑并颠覆几乎所有行业。
正如 Jesan Huang 所说：“未来每一家企业都会是一家 AI 公司，并且都会生产属于自己的 Token。”
对于汽车企业而言，除了造车，它还需要“生产”在车内运行的智能 Token。
在这方面，华为无疑是行业的领跑者。
我相信华为已经在许多内部系统和业务流程中引入了 AI 模型。
如果我能加入华为，我首先会去深入了解华为的 AI 战略，
并尝试思考如何在现有工作流程中构建一个可集成的 AI 子系统，使其成为整体协同的一部分。
我个人已经在日常工作中应用了一些 AI 工具来提升信息流效率，
比如使用 OpenAI 的 Agent Kit、自动化工具 n8n，以及各类生成式 AI 工具。


there are many areas like data processing and information searching, humans are already being outperformed by AI, for instance, AI agents can use function calling to connect with external tools like APIs or data sources like LinkedIn and execute data-collection by itself. But nevertheless, I believe people still have some irreplaceable unique qualities, like empathy and connecting with other people, and creativity and instinct, which I believe is crucial for my role which is 'technology scouting, network building, trend analysis and feasibility reality checks", we still need people to deal with people. So as AI agents are implemented in each step of the workflow, the role I play is 'like a supervisor at work', there is a technical phrase called "AI agent orchestration", someone overseeing how work gets done by AI agents. and I would borrow this analogy to describe our role further, In the same way, when we combine existing technologies and different industries, we end up creating something entirely new. What I mean is, you don't always need to invent something from scratch to be innovative. Sometimes, it's about taking your existing technology and applying them in a new context, and that can open the door to a completely new business or a new industry.

在数据处理、信息搜索等领域，AI 的表现已经在很多方面超越了人类。
例如，AI 智能体（Agent）可以通过函数调用与外部工具或数据源（如 API 或 LinkedIn）连接，
自动执行数据采集与分析任务。
但我仍然坚信，人类依然拥有不可替代的特质——
比如共情力、人际连接、创造力与直觉判断。
这些品质在我所应聘的岗位中——“技术前瞻与趋势分析、合作伙伴拓展与可行性评估”——都是至关重要的。
毕竟，人与人之间的沟通、信任与协作，仍需要“人”来完成。

随着 AI 智能体逐步融入工作流程，我认为自己可以扮演“AI 主管”的角色——
在技术上，这种概念被称为 AI Agent Orchestration（AI 智能体编排），
也就是监督、协调 AI 智能体之间的协作，确保工作以正确的方式完成。
我也会借用这个比喻来形容技术融合：
当我们把不同领域的技术与行业结合在一起，就能创造出全新的东西。
换句话说，创新并不总是“从零开始”，
有时候，只要把已有技术应用到新的场景中，就可能开启一个全新的业务或产业方向。



So, to sum up, I have a dual perspective, I understand both the German way of doing business and the Chinese way. I have substantial Sino-German project experience and a German network, and also technical expertise in mechatronics and AI skills. and I can totally picturing myself doing tasks in the list of the job description and enjoy them, like scouting high-potential technologies, conducting feasibility checks, building the right partnerships with European companies, building innovative and resilient roadmaps, and I believe I can contribute to connecting Europe's tech ecosystem with Huawei's cutting-edge technology and strengthen Huawei's position in Europe. And I would like to apply my skills and my engineering expertise in a structured and meaningful way and grow together and build future together with you and with Huawei.

最后总结一下，
我具备双重视角——既理解德国的商业方式，也理解中国的运作逻辑。
我拥有丰富的中德合作项目经验、在德国的人脉资源，以及机电一体化与人工智能的技术背景。
我完全能够想象自己在岗位描述中的各项任务中投入并享受工作，
比如发掘高潜力技术、进行可行性评估、建立与欧洲企业的战略合作、
以及制定创新而有韧性的技术路线。
我相信我能够在连接欧洲科技生态与华为尖端技术之间发挥桥梁作用，
为华为在欧洲的持续发展贡献力量。
我希望能在这个岗位上，将我的技能与工程背景以更系统、更有意义的方式应用出来，
与您、与华为一起成长，共同打造未来。
