Based on the new sources provided, here is the script of the conversation from the video "What Are Orchestrator Agents? AI Tools Working Smarter Together":

In the past, we've talked about chatbots, AI assistants, and agents. These are helpful tools in the AI space focused around working smarter, not harder, and becoming more productive.

AI assistants are the **DIY** (Do-it-yourself), especially after a user asks a prompt, where you follow the instructions and get work done. On the other hand, **agents** are more like the **DIFY** (Do it for you). Agents can make decisions, kick off workflows, and even use function calling to connect with external tools like APIs or data sources. They can also act autonomously without being prompted or supervised.

Many AI agents are specialized, meaning each one is designed to support a particular area. Some agents focus on business and customer-facing tasks like billing or scheduling, while others handle more technical functions like data retrieval and process automation.

If agents are the future and they're already here, the next step is **agent orchestration**. As AI adoption grows, so does the number of AI tools being developed, deployed, and integrated into various workflows.

**The Problem of Fragmentation**

Different AI assistants and agents handle specialized tasks. Some focus on automating technical operations, some handle different workflows, and some even connect to external data sources like APIs or cloud services. These tools can come from different vendors, operate on different architectures, and may even be distributed across multiple cloud environments or on-premise. The result is a **fragmented AI ecosystem** where tools exist in silos, making coordination, interoperability, and governance increasingly complex.

**The Orchestrator Agent**

This fragmentation brings us to the next key concept: the **orchestrator agent**. The orchestrator agent is a type of agent that specializes in overseeing how work gets done. They are described as being "like a supervisor at work". They supervise how work gets done, ensure everyone's being a team player, and route work to those with the right skills for the job.

In a deployment diagram, they can route across multiple task-oriented AI agents and assistants to get a job done. When the right specialized assistant and agents work together to complete complex workflows and tasks, the experience is coordinated and seamless.

**Steps for Implementation**

In order to facilitate smooth agent-to-agent or agent-to-assistant communication through agent orchestration, teams need to follow three steps:

1.  We'll need to define the task execution sequence or the workflow.
2.  Next, we'll need to set up API integration so that the agent or assistant can access relevant data.
3.  Lastly, we'll need to implement some sort of open source orchestration technology.

Once this is complete, the orchestrator agent takes over real-time execution.

**Benefits of Orchestrator Agents**

Benefits to using orchestrator agents include:

*   **Enhanced efficiency**: Thinking about the concept that it's D-I-F-Y (Do it for you), you can work a lot smarter if you have someone getting some of your to-do list all completed.
*   **Improved experience**: This involves de-siloing, where the more tools you have access to, the better your experience might be.
*   **Scalability**: Considering all of the workflows and decisions agents or assistants can help you make, this can only help your capabilities grow.

By leveraging orchestrator agents, teams can ensure AI tools work together efficiently, reducing complexity and maximizing value, even if they have quite a few AI tools.
